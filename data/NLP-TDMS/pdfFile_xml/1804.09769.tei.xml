				<p>Interacting with relational databases through natural language helps users of any background easily query and analyze a vast amount of data. This requires a system that understands users&apos; questions and converts them to SQL queries automatically. In this paper we present a novel approach, TYPESQL, which views this problem as a slot filling task. Additionally , TYPESQL utilizes type information to better understand rare entities and numbers in natural language questions. We test this idea on the WikiSQL dataset and outperform the prior state-of-the-art by 5.5% in much less time. We also show that accessing the content of databases can significantly improve the performance when users&apos; queries are not well-formed. TYPESQL gets 82.6% accuracy, a 17.5% absolute improvement compared to the previous content-sensitive model.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Building natural language interfaces to relational databases is an important and challenging problem ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Li and Jagadish, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Pasupat and Liang, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Yin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yaghmazadeh et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Xu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wang et al., 2017a</ref>). It requires a system that is able to understand natural language questions and generate corresponding SQL queries. In this paper, we consider the WikiSQL task proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhong et al. (2017)</ref>, a large scale benchmark dataset for the text-to-SQL problem. Given a natural language question for a table and the table's schema, the system needs to produce a SQL query corresponding to the question.</p><p>We introduce a knowledge-based type-aware text-to-SQL generator, TYPESQL. Based on the prior state-of-the-art SQLNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Xu et al., 2017)</ref>, TYPESQL employs a sketch-based approach and views the task as a slot filling problem <ref type="figure">(Fig- ure 2)</ref>. By grouping different slots in a reasonable way and capturing relationships between attributes, TYPESQL outperforms SQLNet by about 3.5% in half of the original training time.</p><p>Furthermore, natural language questions often contain rare entities and numbers specific to the underlying database. Some previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agrawal and Srikant, 2003)</ref> already shows those words are crucial to many downstream tasks, such as infering column names and condition values in the SQL query. However, most of such key words lack accurate embeddings in popular pre-trained word embedding models. In order to solve this problem, TYPESQL assigns each word a type as an entity from either the knowledge graph, a column or a number. For example, for the question in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, we label "mort drucker" as PERSON according to our knowledge graph; "spoofed title," "artist" and "issue" as COLUMN since they are column names; and "88.5" as FLOAT. Incorporating this type information, TYPESQL further improves the state-of-the-art performance by about another 2% on the WikiSQL dataset, resulting in a final 5.5% improvement in total.</p><p>Moreover, most previous work assumes that user queries contain exact column names and entries. However, it is unrealistic that users always formulate their questions with exact column names and string entries in the table. To tackle this issue, when scaleability and privacy are not of a concern, the system needs to search databases to better understand what the user is querying. Our content-sensitive model TYPESQL + TC gains roughly 9% improvement compared to the content-insensitive model, and outperforms the previous content-sensitive model by 17.5%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Semantic parsing maps natural language to meaningful executable programs. The programs could be a range of representations such as logic forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Zelle and Mooney, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wong and Mooney, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Das et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Liang et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Banarescu et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Reddy et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Berant and Liang, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Pasupat and Liang, 2015)</ref>. Another area close to our task is code generation. This task parses natural language descriptions into a more general-purpose programming language such as Python ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Allamanis et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ling et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Rabinovich et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Yin and Neubig, 2017)</ref>. As a sub-task of semantic parsing, the text-to-SQL problem has been studied for decades <ref type="bibr">(War- ren and Pereira, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Popescu et al., 2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Popescu et al., , 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Li et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Giordani and Moschitti, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Wang et al., 2017b</ref>). The methods of the Database community ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Li and Jagadish, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yaghmazadeh et al., 2017</ref>) involve more hand feature engineering and user interactions with the systems. In this work, we focus on recent neural network based approaches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Yin et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Xu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wang et al., 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Iyer et al., 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dong and Lapata (2016)</ref> introduce a sequenceto-sequence approach to converting text to logical forms. Most of previous work focus on specific table schemas, which means they use a single database in both train and test. Thus, they don't generalize to new databases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhong et al. (2017)</ref> publish the WikiSQL dataset and propose a sequence-to-sequence model with reinforcement learning to generate SQL queries. In the problem definition of the WikiSQL task, the databases in the test set do not appear in the train and develop- ment sets. Also, the task needs to take different table schemas into account. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Xu et al. (2017)</ref> further improve the results by using a SQL sketch based approach employing a sequence-to-set model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Methodology</head><p>Like SQLNet, we employ a sketch-based approach and format the task as a slot filling problem. <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 2</ref> shows the SQL sketch. Our model needs to predict all slots that begin with $ in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> illustrates the architecture of TYPE-SQL on the right and a detailed overview of one of three main models MODEL COL on the left. We first preprocess question inputs by type recognition (Section 3.1). Then we use two bi-directional LSTMs to encode words in the question with their types and the column names separately (Section 3.2). The output hidden states of LSTMs are then used to predict the values for the slots in the SQL sketch (Section 3.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Type Recognition for Input Preprocessing</head><p>In order to create one-to-one type input for each question, we, first, tokenize each question into ngrams of length 2 to 6, and use them to search over the table schema and label any column name appears in the question as COLUMN. Then, we assign numbers and dates in the question into four selfexplanatory categories: INTEGER, FLOAT, DATE, and YEAR. To identify named entities, we search for five types of entities: PERSON, PLACE, COUN-TRY, ORGANIZATION, and SPORT, on Freebase 1 using grams as keyword queries. The five categories cover a majority of entities in the dataset. Thus, we do not use other entity types provided by Freebase. Domain-specific knowledge graphs can be used for other applications.</p><p>In the case where the content of databases is available, we match words in the question with both the table schema and the content and labels of the columns as COLUMN and match the entry values as the corresponding column names. For example, the type in the <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> would be [none, column, column, none, artist, artist, none, none, column, none, column, issue, none] in this case. Other parts in the <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> keep the same as the content-insensitive approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Input Encoder</head><p>As shown in the <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, our input encoder consists of two bi-directional LSTMs, BI-LSTM QT and BI-LSTM COL . To encode word and type pairs of the question, we concatenate embeddings of words and their corresponding types and input them to BI-LSTM QT . Then the output hidden states are H QT and H COL , respectively.</p><p>For encoding column names, SQLNet runs a bidirectional LSTM over each column name. We first average the embeddings of words in the column name. Then, we run a single BI-LSTM COL between column names. This encoding method improves the result by 1.5% and cuts the training time by half. Even though the order of column names does not matter, we attribute this improvement to the fact that the LSTM can capture their occurrences and relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Slot-Filling Model</head><p>Next, we predict values for the slots in the SQL sketch. For the slots in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, SQLNet has a separate model for each of them which do not share their trainable parameters. This creates five models for the five slots and one model for $COND# (12 BI-LSTMs in total). However, since the predict procedures of $SELECT COL, $COND COL, and $COND# are similar, we combine them into a single model. Additionally, $COND COL depends on 1 https://developers.google.com/freebase/ the output of $SELECT COL, which reduces errors of predicting the same column in these two slots $COND COL Moreover, we group $OP and $COND VAL together because both depend on the outputs of $COND COL. Furthermore, we use one model for $AGG because we notice that the $AGG model converges much faster and suffers from overfitting when combined with other models. Finally, TYPESQL consists of three models ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  1</ref> right):</p><p>• MODEL COL for $SELECT COL, $COND# and $COND COL</p><p>• MODEL AGG for $AGG</p><p>• MODEL OPVAL for $OP and $COND VAL where the parameters of BI-LSTM QT and BI-LSTM COL are shared in each model (6 BILSTMs in total). Since all three models use the same way to compute the weighted question and type representation H QT/COL using the column attention mechanism proposed in SQLNet, we first introduce the following step in all three models:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">α QT/COL = softmax(H COL W ct H QT ) H QT/COL = α QT/COL H QT</formula><p>where softmax applies the softmax operator over each row of the input matrix, α QT/COL is a matrix of attention scores, and H QT/COL is the weighted question and type representation. In our equations, we use W and V to represent all trainable parameter matrices and vectors, respectively.</p><p>MODEL COL-$SELECT COL H QT/COL is used to predict the column name in the $SELECT COL:  <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dong and Lapata (2016)</ref> 23.3% -37.0% 23.4% -35.9% Augmented Pointer Network ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhong et al., 2017)</ref> 44.1% -53.8% 42.8% -52.8% Seq2SQL ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhong et al., 2017)</ref> 49.5% -60.8% 48.3% -59.4% SQLNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Xu et al., 2017)</ref> -63.2% 69.8% -61.3% 68.0% TypeSQL w/o type-awareness (ours) -66.5% 72.8% -64.9% 71.7% TypeSQL (ours) -68.0% 74.5% -66.7% 73.5% Content Sensitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wang et al. (2017a)</ref> 59.6% -65.2% 59.5% -65.1% TypeSQL+TC (ours) -79.2% 85.5% -75.4% 82.6%  MODEL COL-$COND COL We find that SQLNet often selects the same column name in the $COND COL as $SELECT COL, which is incorrect in most cases. To avoid this problem, we pass the weighted sum of question and type hidden states conditioned on the column chosen in $SELECT COL H QT/SCOL (expended as the same shape of H QT/COL ) to the prediction:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">s = V sel tanh(W sel c H COL + W sel qt H QT/COL ) P sel col = softmax(</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">c = V col tanh(W col c H COL + W col qt H QT/COL + W scol qt H QT/SCOL ) P cond col = softmax(c)</formula><p>MODEL AGG-$AGG Given the weighted sum of question and type hidden states conditioned on the column chosen in $SELECT COL H QT/SCOL , $AGG is chosen from {NULL, MAX, MIN, COUNT, SUM, AVG} in the same way as SQLNet:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P agg = softmax V agg tanh(W agg qt H QT/SCOL )</formula><p>MODEL OPVAL-$OP For each predicted condition column, we choose a $OP from {=, &gt;, &lt;} by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P op = softmax W op t tanh(W op c H COL + W op qt H QT/COL )</formula><p>MODEL OPVAL-$COND VAL Then, we need to generate a substring from the question for each predicted column. As in SQLNet, a bi-directional LSTM is used for the encoder. It employs a pointer network ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Vinyals et al., 2015</ref>) to compute the distribution of the next token in the decoder. In particular, the probability of selecting the i-th token w i in the natural language question as the next token in the substring is computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">v = V val t tanh(W val qt H i QT + W val c H COL + W val h h) P cond val = softmax(v)</formula><p>where h is the hidden state of the previously generated token. The generation process continues until the END token is the most probable next token of the substring. Implementation Details We implement our model based on SQLNet ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Xu et al., 2017</ref>) in PyTorch ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Paszke et al., 2017)</ref>. We concatenate pretrained Glove ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) and paraphrase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wieting and Gimpel, 2017)</ref> embeddings. The dimensions and dropout rates of all hidden layers are set to 120 and 0.3 respectively. We use Adam ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kingma and Ba, 2015)</ref> with the default hyperparameters for optimization. The batch size is set to 64. The same loss functions in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Xu et al., 2017)</ref> are used. Our code is available at https://github.com/taoyds/typesql. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> shows the main results on the WikiSQL task. We compare our work with previous results using the three evaluation metrics used in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Xu et al., 2017)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table  2</ref> provides the breakdown results on AGGREGA-TION, SELECTION, and WHERE clauses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>Without looking at the content of databases, our model outperforms the previous best work by 5.5% on execute accuracy. According to <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, TYPESQL improves the accuracy of SELECT by 1.3% and WHERE clause by 5.9%. By encoding column names and grouping model components in a simpler but reasonable way, TYPESQL achieves a much higher result on the most challenging subtask WHERE clause. Also, the further improvement of integrating word types shows that TYPE-SQL could encode the rare entities and numbers in a better way.</p><p>Also, if complete access to the database is allowed, TYPESQL can achieve 82.6% on execute accuracy, and improves the performance of the previous content-aware system by 17.5%. Although ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhong et al., 2017</ref>) enforced some limitations when creating the WikiSQL dataset, there are still many questions that do not have any column name and entity indicator. This makes generating the right SQLs without searching the database content in such cases impossible. This is not a critical problem for WikiSQL but is so for most realworld tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>We propose TYPESQL for text-to-SQL which views the problem as a slot filling task and uses type information to better understand rare entities and numbers in the input. TYPESQL can use the database content to better understand the user query if it is not well-formed. TYPESQL significantly improves upon the previous state-of-the-art on the WikiSQL dataset.</p><p>Although, unlike most of the previous work, the WikiSQL task requires model to generalize to new databases, the dataset does not cover some important SQL operators such as JOIN and GROUP BY. This limits the generalization of the task to other SQL components. In the future, we plan to advance this work by exploring other more complex datasets under the database-split setting. In this way, we can study the performance of a generalized model on a more realistic text-to-SQL task which includes many complex SQL and different databases.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: TYPESQL consists of three slot-filling models on the right.
