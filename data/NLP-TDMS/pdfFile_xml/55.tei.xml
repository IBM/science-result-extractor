			<abstract>
				<p>We propose a novel approach to Vietnamese word segmentation. Our approach is based on the Single Classification Ripple Down Rules methodology (Compton and Jansen, 1990), where rules are stored in an exception structure and new rules are only added to correct segmentation errors given by existing rules. Experimental results on the benchmark Vietnamese treebank show that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches JVnSegmenter, vnTokenizer, DongDu and UETsegmenter in terms of both accuracy and performance speed. Our code is open-source and available at: https://github.com/datquocnguyen/RDRsegmenter.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Word segmentation is referred to as an important first step for Vietnamese NLP tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Dien et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ha, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Duc Cong et al., 2016)</ref>. Unlike English, white space is a weak indicator of word boundaries in Vietnamese because when written, it is also used to separate syllables that constitute words. For example, a written text "thuu thu nhhp cá nhân" (individual cá_nhân income thu_nhhp tax thuu ) consisting of 5 syllables forms a two-word phrase "thuu_thu_nhhp cá_nhân." 1 More specifically, about 85% of Vietnamese word types are composed of at least two syllables and 80%+ of syllable types are words by themselves ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Thang et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Le et al., 2008)</ref>, thus creating challenges in Vietnamese word segmentation ). Many approaches are proposed for the Vietnamese word segmentation task. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Le et al. (2008)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pham et al. (2009)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tran et al. (2012)</ref> applied the maximum matching strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(NanYuan and YanBin, 1991)</ref> to generate all possible segmentations for each input sentence; then to select the best segmentation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Le et al. (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tran et al. (2012)</ref> used n-gram language models while <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pham et al. (2009)</ref> employed part-ofspeech (POS) information from an external POS tagger. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Nguyen et al. (2006)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Dinh and Vu (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Tran et al.

Another promising approach is joint word segmentation and POS tagging <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Takahashi and Yamamoto, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Nguyen et al., 2017b</ref>), which assigns a combined segmentation and POS tag to each syllable. Furthermore, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Luu and Kazuhide (2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Liu and Lin (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Nguyen and Le (2016)</ref> proposed methods based on pointwise prediction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Neubig and Mori, 2010)</ref>, where a binary classifier is trained to identify whether or not there is a word boundary between two syllables. In this paper, we propose a novel method to Vietnamese word segmentation. Our method automatically constructs a Single Classification Ripple Down Rules (SCRDR) tree <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Compton and Jansen, 1990</ref>) to correct wrong segmentations given by a longest matchingbased word segmenter. On the benchmark Vietnamese treebank <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Nguyen et al., 2009)</ref>, experimental results show that our method obtains better accuracy and performance speed than the previous state-of-the-art methods JVnSegmenter ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Nguyen et al., 2006</ref>), vnTokenizer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Le et al., 2008)</ref>, DongDu (Luu and Kazuhide, 2012) and UETsegmenter (Nguyen and Le, 2016).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">SCRDR methodology</head><p>This section gives a brief introduction of the SCRDR methodology ( <ref type="bibr">Compton and Jansen, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Compton and Jansen, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Richards, 2009)</ref>. A SCRDR tree is a binary tree with only two unique types of edges "except" and "if-not", where every node is associated with a rule in a form of "if condition then conclusion." To ensure that the tree always produces a conclusion, the rule at its root (default) node has a trivial condition which is always satisfied. Each case to be evaluated starts at the root node and ripples down as follows: (i) If the case satisfies the condition of a current node's rule, the case is then passed on to the current node's "except" child if this "except" child exists. (ii) Otherwise, if the case does not satisfy the condition, it is then passed on to the current node's "if-not" child. So, the conclusion returned by the tree is the conclusion of the last satisfied rule in the evaluation path to a leaf node. For example, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> illustrates a SCRDR tree for POS tagging. Let us consider a concrete case "as/IN investors/NNS anticipate/VB a/DT recovery/NN" where "anticipate" and "VB" is the current considered pair of word and its initial POS tag. Because this case satisfies the conditions of the rules at nodes (0), (1) and (3), it is passed on to node (6) using the "except" edge. The case does not satisfy the condition of the rule at node (6), thus it is passed on to node (7) using the "if-not" edge. Finally, the case does not satisfy the condition of the rule at the leaf node (7). So, the rule at node (3)-the last satisfied rule in the the evaluation path (0)-(1)-(3)-(6)- <ref type="formula">(7)</ref>-concludes "VBP" should be the POS tag of the word "anticipate" instead of the initial POS tag "VB." To correct a wrong conclusion returned for a given case, a new node containing a new exception rule may be attached to the last node in the evaluation path. If the last node's rule is the last satisfied rule given the case, the new node is added as its child with the "except" edge; otherwise, the new node is attached with the "if-not" edge. SCRDR has been successfully applied in NLP tasks for temporal relation extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Pham and Hoffmann, 2006</ref>), word lemmatization ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Plisson et al., 2008)</ref>, POS tagging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Xu and Hoffmann, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Nguyen et al., 2011b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Nguyen et al., 2014;</ref>, named entity recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Nguyen and Pham, 2012</ref>  matically, while others manually construct the tree.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Our approach</head><p>This section describes our new error-driven approach to automatically construct a SCRDR tree to correct wrong segmentations produced by an initial word segmenter. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Nguyen et al. (2006)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Tran et al. (2010)</ref>, we also formalize the word segmentation problem as a sequence labeling task. In particular, each syllable is labeled by either segmentation tag B (Begin of a word) or I (Inside of a word). As a result, our approach can be viewed as an extension to word segmentation of the automatic SCRDR approach for POS tagging <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Nguyen et al., 2014;</ref>. Our learning diagram is described in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. We start with an underscore-based gold standard training corpus consisting of manually wordsegmented sentences, e.g. "thuu_thu_nhhp cá_nhân" (individual cá_nhân income thu_nhhp tax thuu ) and transform this corpus into a BI-formed representation (e.g. "thuu/B thu/I nhhp/I cá/B nhân/I"). We then extract syllables to construct the raw corpus (which does not have B and I segmentation tags, and would look like "thuu thu nhhp cá nhân").</p><p>Tuple as key Value ("", "", "", "", thuu, B, thu, B, nhhp, I) B √ ("", "", thuu, B, thu, B, nhhp, I, cá, B) I X (thuu, B, thu, B, nhhp, I, cá, B, nhân, I) I √ (thu, B, nhhp, I, cá, B, nhân, I, "", "") B √</p><p>(nhhp, I, cá, B, nhân, I, "", "", "", "") I √   We apply an initial segmenter on the input raw corpus to get the output BI-formed initialized corpus. For example, given the input raw text "thuu thu nhhp cá nhân", the initial segmenter returns the output BI-formed initialized text "thuu/B thu/B nhhp/I cá/B nhân/I." The initial segmenter in our approach is based on the longest matching strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Poowarawan, 1986)</ref>, using a Vietnamese lexicon from <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Le et al. (2008)</ref>. We then compare the BI-formed gold standard corpus and the BI-formed initialized corpus to generate a 5-syllable context dictionary D where each key-value pair consists of a 5-syllable window tuple as key and a gold standard tag as value. Here, each tuple captures a 5-syllable window context of a current syllable and its initial segmentation tag B/I in a format of (Previous-2nd-syllable, Previous2nd-tag, Previous-1st-syllable, Previous-1st-tag, syllable, tag, Next-1st-syllable, Next-1st-tag, Next-2nd-syllable, Next-2nd-tag) from the initialized corpus, 2 while the gold standard tag is the corresponding segmentation tag of the current syllable in the gold standard corpus. So, a wrong segmentation is when the initial segmentation tag is different from the gold standard tag, as shown in the second row in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Based on the 5-syllable context dictionary D, the rule </p></div>

"s" refers to syllable and "t" refers to B/I segmentation label while subscripts -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 denote indices. For example, (s -1 , s +1 ) represents the rule template "IF Previous-1st-syllable == tuple.Previous1st-syllable &amp;&amp; Next-1st-syllable == tuple.Next-1st-syllable THEN tag = gold-standard-tag", where elements in bold are replaced by concrete values from tuple and gold tag pairs in the 5-syllable context dictionary D. Given (s -1 , s +1 ) and the second row in <ref type="table">Table  1</ref>, we have a concrete rule "IF Previous-1st-syllable == thuu &amp;&amp; Next-1st-syllable == nhhp THEN tag = I."</p><p>selector selects the most suitable rules to construct the SCRDR tree. Concrete rules are generated based on rule templates. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> presents short descriptions of the rule templates. The SCRDR tree is initialized with a default rule-the rule at the root node-and its two exception rules, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>. Our learning process to automatically add new exception rules to the SCRDR tree is as follows:</p><p>• Let us consider a node N in the tree. We define a subset T N of the context dictionary D such that the rule at N is the last satisfied rule in the evaluation path for every tuple in T N but N returns a wrong segmentation tag. For example, given node (2) in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> and D in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, T (2) would contain a pair of the tuple ("", "", thuu, B, thu, B, nhhp, I cá, B) and gold segmentation tag I from the second row in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. A new node containing a new exception rule must be added to the current tree to correct the errors given by N. 3</p><p>• The new exception rule is selected from all concrete rules, in which these concrete rules are generated by applying the rule templates to all tuples in T N . The selected rule must satisfy following constraints: (1) If N is not one of the first three nodes in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref>, then the selected rule's condition must not be satisfied by every tuple for which N already returns a correct segmentation tag. <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> The selected rule is associated with the highest value of the subtraction a − b. Here a is the number of tuples in T N in which each tuple not only satisfies the rule's condition but also gets a correct segmentation tag given by the rule's conclusion, while b is the number of tuples in T N in which each tuple also satisfies the rule's condition but gets a wrong segmentation tag given by the rule's conclusion. <ref type="formula">(3)</ref> The value a − b must be not smaller than a given threshold.</p><p>• This process is repeated until at any node it cannot select a new exception rule satisfying constraints above.</p><p>With the learned SCRDR tree, we perform word segmentation on unsegmented text as follows: The initial segmenter takes the input unsegmented text to generate a BI-formed initialized text. Next, by sliding a 5-syllable window from left to right, a tuple is generated for each syllable in the initialized text; then the learned SCRDR tree takes the input tuple to return a final segmentation tag to the corresponding syllable. Finally, the output of this labeling process is converted to the traditional underscore-based representation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Experimental setup</head><p>Following Nguyen and Le (2016), we conduct experiments and compare the performance of our approach-which we call RDRsegmenter-with published results of other state-of-the-art approaches on the benchmark Vietnamese treebank <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Nguyen et al., 2009</ref>). The training set consists of 75k manually word-segmented sentences (about 23 words per sentence in average). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The test set consists of 2120 sentences (about 31 words per sentence) in 10 files from 800001.seg to 800010.seg. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We use F 1 score as the main evaluation metric to measure the performance of word segmentation. Note that to determine the threshold in our RDRsegmenter, we sampled a development set of 5k sentences from the full training set and used the remaining 70k sentences for training. We found an optimal threshold value at 2 producing the highest F 1 score on the development set. Then we learned a SCRDR tree from the full training set with the optimal threshold, resulting in 1447 rules in total. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The data, officially released in 2013, is provided for research or educational purpose by the national project VLSP on Vietnamese language and speech processing. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> The test set was originally released for evaluation in the POS tagging shared task at the VLSP 2013 workshop.</p></div>

In <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, we show F 1 scores of RDRsegmenter and UETsegmenter at different training sizes, showing that RDRsegmenter clearly improves performance in a smaller dataset scenario. It is worth noting that on a personal computer of In-tel Core i7 2.2 GHz, our RDRsegmenter processes at a speed of 62k words per second in a single threaded implementation, which is 1.3 times faster than UETsegmenter. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Nguyen and Le (2016)</ref> showed that UETsegmenter is faster than vnTokenizer, JVnSegmenter and DongDu. 7 So RDRsegmenter is also faster than vnTokenizer, JVnSegmenter and DongDu.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have proposed a new error-driven method to automatically construct a Single Classification Ripple Down Rules tree for Vietnamese word segmentation. Experiments on the benchmark Vietnamese treebank show that our method obtains better accuracy and speed than previous approaches. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ datquocnguyen/RDRsegmenter. Note that excluding the language-specific initial segmenter, our method generally can be viewed as a language independent approach. Here, a Vietnamese syllable is analogous to a character in other languages such as Chinese and Japanese. So we will adapt our method to those languages in future work.</p></div>
