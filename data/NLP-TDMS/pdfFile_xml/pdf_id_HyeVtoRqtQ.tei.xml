				<p>We present trellis networks, a new architecture for sequence modeling. On the one hand, a trellis network is a temporal convolutional network with special structure , characterized by weight tying across depth and direct injection of the input into deep layers. On the other hand, we show that truncated recurrent networks are equivalent to trellis networks with special sparsity structure in their weight matrices. Thus trellis networks with general weight matrices generalize truncated recurrent networks. We leverage these connections to design high-performing trellis networks that absorb structural and algorithmic elements from both recurrent and convolutional models. Experiments demonstrate that trellis networks outper-form the current state of the art on a variety of challenging benchmarks, including word-level language modeling on Penn Treebank and WikiText-103, character-level language modeling on Penn Treebank, and stress tests designed to evaluate long-term memory retention.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>What is the best architecture for sequence modeling? Recent research has produced significant progress on multiple fronts. Recurrent networks, such as LSTMs, continue to be optimized and extended <ref type="bibr">(Merity et al., 2018b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Melis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Trinh et al., 2018)</ref>. Temporal convolutional networks have demonstrated impressive performance, particularly in modeling longrange context (van den <ref type="bibr">Oord et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bai et al., 2018)</ref>. And architectures based on self-attention are gaining ground ( <ref type="bibr">Vaswani et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Santoro et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we introduce a new architecture for sequence modeling, the Trellis Network. We aim to both improve empirical performance on sequence modeling benchmarks and shed light on the relationship between two existing model families: recurrent and convolutional networks.</p><p>On the one hand, a trellis network is a special temporal convolutional network, distinguished by two unusual characteristics. First, the weights are tied across layers. That is, weights are shared not only by all time steps but also by all network layers, tying them into a regular trellis pattern. Second, the input is injected into all network layers. That is, the input at a given time-step is provided not only to the first layer, but directly to all layers in the network. So far, this may seem merely as a peculiar convolutional network for processing sequences, and not one that would be expected to perform particularly well.</p><p>Yet on the other hand, we show that trellis networks generalize truncated recurrent networks (recurrent networks with bounded memory horizon). The precise derivation of this connection is one of the key contributions of our work. It allows trellis networks to serve as bridge between recurrent and convolutional architectures, benefitting from algorithmic and architectural techniques developed in either context. We leverage these relationships to design high-performing trellis networks that absorb ideas from both architectural families. Beyond immediate empirical gains, these connections may serve as a step towards unification in sequence modeling.</p><p>We evaluate trellis networks on challenging benchmarks, including word-level language modeling on the standard Penn Treebank and the much larger WikiText-103 datasets; character-level language modeling on Penn Treebank; and standard stress tests designed to evaluate long-term memory retention. Trellis networks outperform state-of-the-art models across the board. On word-level Penn Treebank, a trellis network outperforms by more than a unit of perplexity the recent architecture search work of <ref type="bibr">Pham et al. (2018)</ref>, as well as the recent results of <ref type="bibr">Melis et al. (2018)</ref>, which leveraged the Google Vizier service for exhaustive hyperparameter search. On character-level Penn Tree-bank, a trellis network outperforms the thorough optimization work of <ref type="bibr">Merity et al. (2018a)</ref>. On word-level WikiText-103, a trellis network outperforms by 4% in perplexity the contemporaneous self-attention-based Relational Memory Core ( <ref type="bibr">Santoro et al., 2018)</ref>, and by 8% the work of <ref type="bibr">Merity et al. (2018a)</ref>. On stress tests, trellis networks outperform recent state-of-the-art results achieved by recurrent networks and self-attention (Transformer) ( <ref type="bibr">Trinh et al., 2018)</ref>. It is notable that the state of the art across these benchmarks was held by models with sometimes dramatic mutual differences.</p></div>

Recurrent architectures have been used to achieve breakthrough results in natural language processing and other domains <ref type="bibr">(Sutskever et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Graves, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vinyals et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Karpathy &amp; Li, 2015)</ref>. Convolutional networks have also been widely used for sequence processing ( <ref type="bibr">Waibel et al., 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Collobert et al., 2011</ref>). Recent work indicates that convolutional networks are effective on a variety of sequence modeling tasks, particularly ones that demand long-range information propagation (van den <ref type="bibr">Oord et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Kalchbrenner et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gehring et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bai et al., 2018)</ref>. A third notable approach to sequence processing that has recently gained ground is based on self-attention ( <ref type="bibr">Vaswani et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Santoro et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2018)</ref>. Our work is most closely related to the first two approaches. In particular, we establish a strong connection between recurrent and convolutional networks and introduce a model that serves as a bridge between the two. A related recent theoretical investigation showed that under a certain stability condition, recurrent networks can be well-approximated by feed-forward models <ref type="bibr">(Miller &amp; Hardt, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>There have been many combinations of convolutional and recurrent networks ( <ref type="bibr">Sainath et al., 2015)</ref>. For example, convolutional LSTMs combine convolutional and recurrent units ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Donahue et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Venugopalan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shi et al., 2015)</ref>. Quasi-recurrent neural networks interleave convolutional and recurrent layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bradbury et al., 2017)</ref>. Techniques introduced for convolutional networks, such as dilation, have been applied to RNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chang et al., 2017)</ref>. Our work establishes a deeper connection, deriving a direct mapping across the two architectural families and providing a structural bridge that can incorporate techniques from both sides.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRELLISNET, TCN, AND RNN</head><p>In this section we analyze the relationships between trellis networks, convolutional networks, and recurrent networks. In particular, we show that trellis networks can serve as a bridge between convolutional and recurrent networks. On the one hand, TrellisNet is a special form of temporal convolutional networks (TCN); this has already been clear in Section 3 and will be discussed further in Section 4.1. On the other hand, any truncated RNN can be represented as a TrellisNet with special structure in the interlayer transformations; this will be the subject of Section 4.2. These connections allow TrellisNet to harness architectural elements and regularization techniques from both TCNs and RNNs; this will be summarized in Section 4.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">TRELLISNET AND TCN</head><p>We briefly introduce TCNs here, and refer the readers to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bai et al. (2018)</ref> for a more thorough discussion. Briefly, a temporal convolutional network (TCN) is a ConvNet that uses one dimensional convolutions over the sequence. The convolutions are causal, meaning that, at each layer, the transformation at time t can only depend on previous layer units at times t or earlier, not from later points in time. Such approaches were used going back to the late 1980s, under the name of "time-delay neural networks" ( <ref type="bibr">Waibel et al., 1989)</ref>, and have received significant interest in recent years due to their application in architectures such as WaveNet (van den <ref type="bibr">Oord et al., 2016</ref>).</p><p>In essence, TrellisNet is a special kind of temporal convolutional network. TCNs have two distinctive characteristics: 1) causal convolution in each layer to satisfy the causality constraint and 2) deep stacking of layers to increase the effective history length (i.e. receptive field). Trellis networks have both of these characteristics. The basic model presented in Section 3 can easily be elaborated with larger kernel sizes, dilated convolutions, and other architectural elements used in TCNs; some of these are reviewed further in Section 4.3.</p><p>However, TrellisNet is not a general TCN. As mentioned in Section 3, two important differences are: 1) the weights are tied across layers and 2) the linearly transformed input˜xinput˜ input˜x 1:T is injected into each layer. Weight tying can be viewed as a form of regularization that can stabilize training, support generalization, and significantly reduce the size of the model. Input injection mixes deep features with the original sequence. These structural characteristics will be further illuminated by the connection between trellis networks and recurrent networks, presented next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">TRELLISNET AND RNN</head><p>Recurrent networks appear fundamentally different from convolutional networks. Instead of operating on all elements of a sequence in parallel in each layer, an RNN processes one input element at a time and unrolls in the time dimension. Given a non-linearity g (which could be a sigmoid or a more elaborate cell), we can summarize the transformations in an L-layer RNN at time-step t as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">h (i) t = g W (i) hx h (i−1) t + W (i) hh h (i) t−1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ L, h<label>(0)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">t = x t .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Despite the apparent differences, we will now show that any RNN unrolled to a finite length is equivalent to a TrellisNet with special sparsity structure in the kernel matrix W . We begin by formally defining the notion of a truncated (i.e. finite-horizon) RNN. Definition 1. Given an RNN ρ, a corresponding M-truncated RNN ρ M , applied to the sequence x 1:T , produces at time step t the output y t by applying ρ to the sequence x t−M +1:t (here x &lt;0 = 0). Theorem 1. Let ρ M be an M -truncated RNN with L layers and hidden unit dimensionality d. Then there exists an equivalent TrellisNet τ with depth (M + L − 1) and layer width (i.e. number of channels in each hidden layer) Ld. That is, for any x 1:T , τ (x 1:T ) = ρ M (x 1:T ).</p><p>Theorem 1 states that any M -truncated RNN can be represented as a TrellisNet. How severe of a restriction is M -truncation? Note that M -truncation is intimately related to truncated backpropagation-through-time <ref type="bibr">(BPTT)</ref>, used pervasively in training recurrent networks on long sequences. While RNNs can in principle retain unlimited history, there is both empirical and theoretical evidence that the memory horizon of RNNs is bounded ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bai et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Khandelwal et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Miller &amp; Hardt, 2018)</ref>. Furthermore, if desired, TrellisNets can recover exactly a common method of applying RNNs to long sequences -hidden state repackaging, i.e. copying the hidden state across subsequences. This is accomplished using an analogous form of hidden state repackaging, detailed in Appendix B.</p><p>Proof of Theorem 1. We define h t,t ∈ R d as the RNN hidden state at time t but when the history started at time t . Note that in typical RNNs, we assume the history starts at time t = 1, so h (i)</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">t,1 = h (i)</formula><p>t . When t &gt; t, we assume h t,t = 0 (i.e., no history information if the clock starts in the future).</p><p>By assumption, ρ M is an RNN defined by the following parameters: {W</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">(i) hx , W (i) hh , g, M }, where W (i) hh ∈ R w×d for all i, W (1)</formula><p>hx ∈ R w×p , and W (i) hx ∈ R w×d for all i = 2, . . . , L are the weight matrices at each layer (w is the dimension of pre-activation output). We now construct a TrellisNet τ according to the exact definition in Section 3, with parameters {W 1 , W 2 , f }, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">W 1 =       0 W (1) hh 0 . . . 0 0 0 W (2) hh . . . 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 0 0 . . .

Meanwhile, we define non-linearity f by f (α, β) = g(α) (i.e., applying g only on the first entry).</p><p>Let t ∈ [T ] be arbitrary and fixed. We now claim that the hidden unit at time t and layer j of TrellisNet τ can be expressed in terms of hidden units in RNN ρ M (note: j is the layer in τ , while i in h</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">(i)</formula><p>t,t is the layer index in ρ M ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">z (j) t = h (1) t,t−j+1 h (2) t,t−j+2 . . . h (L) t,t−j+L ∈ R Ld<label>(6)</label></formula><p>We prove this claim by induction on j. As a base case, consider j = 0; i.e., the input level of τ . Since h t,t = 0 when t &gt; t, we have that</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">z (0) j = [0 0 . . . 0]</formula><p>indeed (recall that in the input level of TrellisNet we initialize z (0) t = 0). For the inductive step, suppose Eq. (6) holds for level j, and consider level j + 1. By the feed-forward transformation of TrellisNet defined in Eq. (2) and the nonlinearity f we defined above, we have that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">ˆ z (j+1) t = W 1 x t−1 z (j) t−1 + W 2 x t z (j) t (7) =       0 W (1) hh 0 . . . 0 0 0 W (2) hh . . . 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0 0 0 . . .

Therefore, by induction, we have shown that Eq. (6) holds for all j ≥ 0.

From convolutional networks, we can adapt 1) larger kernels and dilated convolutions <ref type="bibr">(Yu &amp; Koltun, 2016)</ref>; 2) auxiliary losses at intermediate layers ( <ref type="bibr">Lee et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Xie &amp; Tu, 2015)</ref>; 3) weight normalization <ref type="bibr">(Salimans &amp; Kingma, 2016)</ref>; and 4) parallel convolutional processing. Being able to directly incorporate techniques from both streams of research is one of the benefits of trellis networks. We leverage this in our experiments and provide a more comprehensive treatment of these adaptations in Appendix B.</p></div>

Our choice is inspired directly by Theorem 1, which suggests incorporating an existing RNN cell into TrellisNet.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">RESULTS</head><p>We evaluate trellis networks on word-level and character-level language modeling on the standard Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset <ref type="bibr">(Marcus et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mikolov et al., 2010</ref>), large-scale word-level modeling on WikiText-103 (WT103) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Merity et al., 2017)</ref>, and standard stress tests used to study long-range information propagation in sequence models: sequential MNIST, permuted MNIST (PMNIST), and sequential CIFAR-10 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chang et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bai et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Trinh et al., 2018)</ref>. Note that these tasks are on very different scales, with unique properties that challenge sequence models in different ways. For example, word-level PTB is a small dataset that a typical model easily overfits, so judicious regularization is essential. WT103 is a hundred times larger, with less danger of overfitting, but with a vocabulary size of 268K that makes training more challenging (and precludes the application of techniques such mixture of softmaxes ( <ref type="bibr">Yang et al., 2018)</ref>). A more complete description of these tasks and their characteristics can be found in Appendix C.</p><p>The prior state of the art on these tasks was set by completely different models, such as AWD-LSTM on character-level PTB ( <ref type="bibr">Merity et al., 2018a</ref>), neural architecture search on word-level PTB ( <ref type="bibr">Pham et al., 2018)</ref>, and the self-attention-based Relational Memory Core on WikiText-103 ( <ref type="bibr">Santoro et al., 2018)</ref>. We use trellis networks on all tasks and outperform the respective state-of-the-art models on each. For example, on word-level Penn Treebank, TrellisNet outperforms by a good margin the  Character-level language modeling. When used for character-level modeling, PTB is a mediumscale dataset. We thus use a deeper network as well as techniques such as weight normalization <ref type="bibr">(Sal- imans &amp; Kingma, 2016)</ref> and deep supervision ( <ref type="bibr">Lee et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Xie &amp; Tu, 2015)</ref>. The results are  Long-range modeling with Sequential MNIST, PMNIST, and CIFAR-10. We also evaluate the TrellisNet for ability to model long-term dependencies. In the Sequential MNIST, PMNIST, and CIFAR-10 tasks, images are processed as long sequences, one pixel at a time ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chang et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bai et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Trinh et al., 2018)</ref>. Our model has 8M parameters, in alignment with prior work. To cover the larger context, we use dilated convolutions in intermediate layers, adopting a common architectural element from TCNs ( <ref type="bibr">Yu &amp; Koltun, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">van den Oord et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bai et al., 2018</ref>).</p><p>The results are listed in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>. Note that the performance of prior models is inconsistent. The Transformer works well on MNIST but fairs poorly on CIFAR-10, while r-LSTM with unsupervised auxiliary losses achieves good results on CIFAR-10 but underperforms on Permuted MNIST. TrellisNet outperforms all these models on all three tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">DISCUSSION</head><p>We presented trellis networks, a new architecture for sequence modeling. Trellis networks form a structural bridge between convolutional and recurrent models. This enables direct assimilation of many techniques designed for either of these two architectural families. We leverage these connections to train high-performing trellis networks that set a new state of the art on highly competitive language modeling benchmarks. Beyond the empirical gains, we hope that trellis networks will serve as a step towards deeper and more unified understanding of sequence modeling.</p><p>There are many exciting opportunities for future work. First, we have not conducted thorough performance optimizations on trellis networks. For example, architecture search on the structure of the gated activation f may yield a higher-performing activation function than the classic LSTM cell we used <ref type="bibr">(Zoph &amp; Le, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pham et al., 2018)</ref>. Likewise, principled hyperparameter tuning will likely improve modeling accuracy beyond the levels we have observed ( <ref type="bibr">Melis et al., 2018)</ref>. Future work can also explore acceleration schemes that speed up training and inference. Another significant opportunity is to establish connections between trellis networks and self-attention-based architectures (Transformers) ( <ref type="bibr">Vaswani et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Santoro et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2018)</ref>, thus unifying all three major contemporary approaches to sequence modeling. Finally, we look forward to seeing applications of trellis networks to industrial-scale challenges such as machine translation.</p><p>Rafal Jozefowicz, Wojciech Zaremba, and Ilya Sutskever.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C BENCHMARK TASKS</head><p>Word-level language modeling on Penn Treebank (PTB). The original Penn Treebank (PTB) dataset selected 2,499 stories from a collection of almost 100K stories published in Wall Street Journal (WSJ) <ref type="bibr">(Marcus et al., 1993)</ref>. After <ref type="bibr">Mikolov et al. (2010)</ref> processed the corpus, the PTB dataset contains 888K words for training, 70K for validation and 79K for testing, where each sentence is marked with an &lt;eos&gt; tag at its end. All of the numbers (e.g. in financial news) were replaced with a ? symbol with many punctuations removed. Though small, PTB has been a highly studied dataset in the domain of language modeling <ref type="bibr">(Miyamoto &amp; Cho, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zilly et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Merity et al., 2018b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Melis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yang et al., 2018)</ref>. Due to its relatively small size, many computational models can easily overfit on word-level PTB. Therefore, good regularization methods and optimization techniques designed for sequence models are especially important on this benchmark task ( <ref type="bibr">Merity et al., 2018b</ref>).</p><p>Word-level language modeling on WikiText-103. WikiText-103 (WT103) is 110 times larger than PTB, containing a training corpus from 28K lightly processed Wikipedia articles ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Merity et al., 2017)</ref>. In total, WT103 features a vocabulary size of about 268K 1 , with 103M words for training, 218K words for validation, and 246K words for testing/evaluation. The WT103 corpus also retains the original case, punctuation and numbers in the raw data, all of which were removed from the PTB corpus. Moreover, since WT103 is composed of full articles (whereas PTB is sentence-based), it is better suited for testing long-term context retention. For these reasons, WT103 is typically considered much more representative and realistic than PTB ( <ref type="bibr">Merity et al., 2018a</ref>).</p><p>Character-level language modeling on Penn Treebank (PTB). When used for character-level language modeling, PTB is a medium size dataset that contains 5M chracters for training, 396K for validation, and 446K for testing, with an alphabet size of 50 (note: the &lt;eos&gt; tag that marks the end of a sentence in word-level tasks is now considered one character). While the alphabet size of char-level PTB is much smaller compared to the word-level vocabulary size (10K), there is much longer sequential token dependency because a sentence contains many more characters than words.</p><p>Sequential and permuted MNIST classification. The MNIST handwritten digits dataset ( <ref type="bibr">LeCun et al., 1989</ref>) contains 60K normalized training images and 10K testing images, all of size 28 × 28. In the sequential MNIST task, MNIST images are presented to the sequence model as a flattened 784 × 1 sequence for digit classification. Accurate predictions therefore require good long-term memory of the flattened pixels -longer than in most language modeling tasks. In the setting of permuted MNIST (PMNIST), the order of the sequence is permuted at random, so the network can no longer rely on local pixel features for classification.</p><p>Sequential CIFAR-10 classification. The CIFAR-10 dataset <ref type="bibr">(Krizhevsky &amp; Hinton, 2009</ref>) contains 50K images for training and 10K for testing, all of size 32 × 32. In the sequential CIFAR-10 task, these images are passed into the model one at each time step, flattended as in the MNIST tasks. Compared to sequential MNIST, this task is more challenging. For instance, CIFAR-10 contains more complex image structures and intra-class variations, and there are 3 channels to the input. Moreover, as the images are larger, a sequence model needs to have even longer memory than in sequential MNIST or PMNIST ( <ref type="bibr">Trinh et al., 2018</ref>). <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> specifies the trellis networks used for the various tasks. There are a few things to note while reading the table. First, in training, we decay the learning rate once the validation error plateaus for a while (or according to some fixed schedule, such as after 100 epochs). Second, for auxiliary loss (see Appendix B for more details), we insert the loss function after every fixed number of layers in the network. This "frequency" is included below under the "Auxiliary Frequency" entry. Finally, the hidden dropout in the <ref type="table">Table refers</ref> to the variational dropout we translated from RNNs (see Appendix B), which is applied at all hidden layers of the TrellisNet. Due to the insight from Theorem 1, many techniques in TrellisNet were translated directly from RNNs or TCNs. Thus, most of the hyperparameters were based on the numbers reported in prior works (e.g., embedding size, embedding dropout, hidden dropout, output dropout, optimizer, weight-decay, etc.) with minor adjustments ( <ref type="bibr">Merity et al., 2018b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bradbury et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Merity et al., 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Trinh et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bai et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Santoro et al., 2018</ref>). For factors such as auxiliary loss weight and frequency, we perform a basic grid search. We have also performed an ablation study on TrellisNet to study the influence of various ingredients and techniques on performance. We conduct the study on word-level PTB using a TrellisNet with 24M parameters. When we study one factor (e.g., removing hidden dropout), all hyperparameters and settings remain the same as in column 1 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> (except for the "Dense Kernel", where we adjust the number of hidden units so that the model size remains the same). The results are as follows: </p></div>

recent results of Melis et al. (2018), which used the Google Vizier service for exhaustive hyper-
parameter tuning, as well as the recent neural architecture search work of Pham et al. (2018). On 
WikiText-103, a trellis network outperforms by 4% the Relational Memory Core (Santoro et al., 
2018) and by 8% the thorough optimization work of Merity et al. (2018a). 

Many hyperparameters we use are adapted directly from prior work on recurrent networks. (As 
highlighted in Section 4.3, many techniques can be carried over directly from RNNs). For others, 
we perform a basic grid search. We decay the learning rate by a fixed factor once validation error 
plateaus. All hyperparameters are reported in Appendix D, along with an ablation study. A complete 
implementation will be released. 

Word-level language modeling. For word-level language modeling, we use PTB and WT103. The 
results on PTB are listed in Table 1. TrellisNet sets a new state of the art on PTB, both with and 
without mixture of softmaxes (Yang et al., 2018), outperforming all previously published results by 
more than one unit of perplexity. 

WT103 is 110 times larger than PTB, with vocabulary size 268K. We follow prior work and use 
the adaptive softmax (Grave et al., 2017a), which improves memory efficiency by assigning higher 
capacity to more frequent words. The results are listed in Table 2. TrellisNet sets a new state of 
the art on this dataset as well, with perplexity 30.35: about 4% better than the contemporaneous 
self-attention-based Relational Memory Core (RMC) (Santoro et al., 2018). TrellisNet achieves this 
better accuracy with much faster convergence: 22 epochs, versus 90 for RMC.
