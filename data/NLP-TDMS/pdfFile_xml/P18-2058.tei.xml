				<p>Recent BIO-tagging-based neural semantic role labeling models are very high performing , but assume gold predicates as part of the input and cannot incorporate span-level features. We propose an end-to-end approach for jointly predicting all predicates, arguments spans, and the relations between them. The model makes independent decisions about what relationship , if any, holds between every possible word-span pair, and learns contextu-alized span representations that provide rich, shared input features for each decision. Experiments demonstrate that this approach sets a new state of the art on PropBank SRL without gold predicates. 1</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Semantic role labeling (SRL) captures predicateargument relations, such as "who did what to whom." Recent high-performing SRL models <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Marcheggiani et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tan et al., 2018)</ref> are BIO-taggers, labeling argument spans for a single predicate at a time (as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1</ref>). They are typically only evaluated with gold predicates, and must be pipelined with error-prone predicate identification models for deployment.</p><p>We propose an end-to-end approach for predicting all the predicates and their argument spans in one forward pass. Our model builds on a recent coreference resolution model ( , by making central use of learned, contextualized span representations. We use these representations to predict SRL graphs directly over text spans. Each edge is identified by independently predicting which role, if any, holds between every possible pair of text spans, while using aggressive beam <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Code and models: https://github.com/luheng/lsgn pruning for efficiency. The final graph is simply the union of predicted SRL roles (edges) and their associated text spans (nodes). Our span-graph formulation overcomes a key limitation of semi-markov and BIO-based models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Kong et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhou and Xu, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yang and Mitchell, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Tan et al., 2018)</ref>: it can model overlapping spans across different predicates in the same output structure (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). The span representations also generalize the token-level representations in BIObased models, letting the model dynamically decide which spans and roles to include, without using previously standard syntactic features <ref type="bibr">(Pun- yakanok et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">FitzGerald et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first span-based SRL model that does not assume that predicates are given. In this more realistic setting, where the predicate must be predicted, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on PropBank. It also reinforces the strong performance of similar span embedding methods for coreference ( , suggesting that this style of models could be used for other span-span relation tasks, such as syntactic parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Stern et al., 2017)</ref>, relation extraction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Miwa and Bansal, 2016)</ref>, and QA-SRL ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">FitzGerald et al., 2018</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Model</head><p>We consider the space of possible predicates to be all the tokens in the input sentence, and the space of arguments to be all continuous spans. Our model decides what relation exists between each predicate-argument pair (including no relation).</p><p>Formally, given a sequence X = w 1 , . . . , w n , we wish to predict a set of labeled predicateargument relations Y ⊆ P × A × L, where P = {w 1 , . . . , w n } is the set of all tokens (predicates), A = {(w i , . . . , w j ) | 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n} contains all the spans (arguments), and L is the space of semantic role labels, including a null label indicating no relation. The final SRL output would be all the non-empty relations</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">{(p, a, l) ∈ Y | l = }.</formula><p>We then define a set of random variables, where each random variable y p,a corresponds to a predicate p ∈ P and an argument a ∈ A, taking value from the discrete label space L. The random variables y p,a are conditionally independent of each other given the input X:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P (Y | X) = p∈P,a∈A P (y p,a | X) (1) P (y p,a = l | X) = exp(φ(p, a, l)) l ∈L exp(φ(p, a, l ))<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Where φ(p, a, l) is a scoring function for a possible (predicate, argument, label) combination. φ is decomposed into two unary scores on the predicate and the argument (defined in Section 3), as well as a label-specific score for the relation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">φ(p, a, l) = Φ a (a) + Φ p (p) + Φ (l) rel (a, p) (3)</formula><p>The score for the null label is set to a constant: φ(p, a, ) = 0, similar to logistic regression.</p><p>Learning For each input X, we minimize the negative log likelihood of the gold structure Y * :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">J (X) = − log P (Y * | X)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Beam pruning As our model deals with O(n 2 ) possible argument spans and O(n) possible predicates, it needs to consider O(n 3 |L|) possible relations, which is computationally impractical. To overcome this issue, we define two beams B a and B p for storing the candidate arguments and predicates, respectively. The candidates in each beam are ranked by their unary score (Φ a or Φ p ). The sizes of the beams are limited by λ a n and λ p n. Elements that fall out of the beam do not participate in computing the edge factors Φ (l) rel , reducing the overall number of relational factors evaluated by the model to O(n 2 |L|). We also limit the maximum width of spans to a fixed number W (e.g. W = 30), further reducing the number of computed unary factors to O(n).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>We ELMo embeddings To further improve performance, we also add ELMo word representations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Peters et al., 2018</ref>) to the BiLSTM input (in the +ELMo rows). Since the contextualized representations ELMo provides can be applied to most previous neural systems, the improvement is orthogonal to our contribution. In <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>   Effectiveness of beam pruning <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows the predicate and argument spans kept in the beam, sorted with their unary scores. Our model efficiently prunes unlikely argument spans and predicates, significantly reduces the number of edges it needs to consider. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows the recall of predicate words on the CoNLL 2012 development set. By retaining λ p = 0.4 predicates per word, we are able to keep over 99.7% argument-bearing predicates.

Our model is better at accurately predicting arguments that are farther away from the predicates, even  compared to an ensemble model ( ) that has a higher overall F1. This is very likely due to architectural differences; in a BIO tagger, predicate information passes through many LSTM timesteps before reaching a long-distance argument, whereas our architecture enables direct connections between all predicates-arguments pairs.</p><p>Agreement with syntax As mentioned in , their BIO-based SRL system has good agreement with gold syntactic span boundaries (94.3%) but falls short of previous syntaxbased systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Punyakanok et al., 2004</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref> shows its viola- tions of global structural constraints 5 compared to previous systems. Our model made more constraint violations compared to previous systems. For example, our model predicts duplicate core arguments 6 (shown in the U column in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref>) more often than previous work. This is due to the fact that our model uses independent classifiers to label each predicate-argument pair, making it difficult for them to implicitly track the decisions made for several arguments with the same predicate. The Ours+decode row in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref> shows SRL performance after enforcing the U-constraint using dynamic programming <ref type="bibr">(Täckström et al., 2015</ref>) at decoding time. Constrained decoding at test time is effective at eliminating all the core-role inconsistencies (shown in the U-column), but did not bring significant gain on the end result (shown 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Punyakanok et al.

In the end-to-end setup, a system takes a tokenized sentence as input, and predicts all the predicates and their arguments. Systems are evaluated on the micro-averaged F1 for correctly predicting (pred- icate, argument span, label) tuples. For compari- son with previous systems, we also report results with gold predicates, in which the complete set of predicates in the input sentence is given as well.
