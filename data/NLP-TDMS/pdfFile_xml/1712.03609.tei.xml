				<p>Reading a document and extracting an answer to a question about its content has attracted substantial attention recently. While most work has focused on the interaction between the question and the document, in this work we evaluate the importance of context when the question and document are processed independently. We take a standard neural architecture for this task, and show that by providing rich contextualized word representations from a large pre-trained language model as well as allowing the model to choose between context-dependent and context-independent word representations , we can obtain dramatic improvements and reach performance comparable to state-of-the-art on the competitive SQUAD dataset.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Reading comprehension (RC) is a high-level task in natural language understanding that requires reading a document and answering questions about its content. RC has attracted substantial attention over the last few years with the advent of large annotated datasets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hermann et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rajpurkar et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Trischler et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Nguyen et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Joshi et al., 2017)</ref>, computing resources, and neural network models and optimization procedures <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sukhbaatar et al., 2015;</ref>.</p><p>Reading comprehension models must invariably represent word tokens contextually, as a function of their encompassing sequence (document or question). The vast majority of RC systems encode contextualized representations of words in both the document and question as hidden states of bidirectional RNNs <ref type="bibr">(Hochreiter and Schmid- huber, 1997</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schuster and Paliwal, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cho et al., 2014</ref>), and focus model design and capacity around question-document interaction, carrying out calculations where information from both is available ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Seo et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Xiong et al., 2017b;</ref>).</p><p>Analysis of current RC models has shown that models tend to react to simple word-matching between the question and document <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Jia and Liang, 2017)</ref>, as well as benefit from explicitly providing matching information in model inputs ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Weissenborn et al., 2017)</ref>. In this work, we hypothesize that the stillrelatively-small size of RC datasets drives this behavior, which leads to models that make limited use of context when representing word tokens.</p><p>To illustrate this idea, we take a model that carries out only basic question-document interaction and prepend to it a module that produces token embeddings by explicitly gating between contextual and non-contextual representations (for both the document and question). This simple addition already places the model's performance on par with recent work, and allows us to demonstrate the importance of context.</p><p>Motivated by these findings, we turn to a semisupervised setting in which we leverage a language model, pre-trained on large amounts of data, as a sequence encoder which forcibly facilitates context utilization. We find that model performance substantially improves, reaching accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art on the competitive SQuAD dataset, showing that contextual word representations captured by the language model are beneficial for reading comprehension. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Contextualized Word Representations</head><p>Problem definition We consider the task of extractive reading comprehension: given a paragraph of text p = (p 1 , . . . , p n ) and a question q = (q 1 , . . . , q m ), an answer span (p l , . . . , p r ) is to be extracted, i.e., a pair of indices 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n into p are to be predicted.</p><p>When encoding a word token in its encompassing sequence (question or passage), we are interested in allowing extra computation over the sequence and evaluating the extent to which context is utilized in the resultant representation.</p><p>To that end, we employ a re-embedding component in which a contextual and a non-contextual representation are explicitly combined per token. Specifically, for a sequence of word-embeddings w 1 , . . . , w k with w t ∈ R dw , the re-embedding of the t-th token w t is the result of a Highway layer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Srivastava et al., 2015)</ref> and is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">w t = g t w t + (1 − g t ) z t g t = σ(W g x t + U g u t ) z t = tanh(W z x t + U z u t )</formula><p>where x t is a function strictly of the word-type of the t-th token, u t is a function of the enclosing sequence, W g , W z , U g , U z are parameter matrices, and the element-wise product operator. We set x t = [w t ; c t ], a concatenation of w t with c t ∈ R dc where the latter is a character-based representation of the token's word-type produced via a CNN over character embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kim, 2014)</ref>. We note that word-embeddings w t are pre-trained ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) and are kept fixed during training, as is commonly done in order to reduce model capacity and mitigate overfitting. We next describe different formulations for the contextual term u t .</p><p>RNN-based token re-embedding (TR) Here we set {u 1 , . . . , u k } = BiLSTM(x 1 , . . . , x k ) as the hidden states of the top layer in a stacked BiLSTM of multiple layers, each uni-directional LSTM in each layer having d h cells and u k ∈ R 2d h .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>LM-augmented token re-embedding (TR+LM)</head><p>The simple module specified above allows better exploitation of the context that a token appears in, if such exploitation is needed and is not learned by the rest of the network, which operates over w 1 , . . . , w k . Our findings in Section 4 indicate that context is crucial but that in our setting it may be utilized to a limited extent.</p><p>We hypothesize that the main determining factor in this behavior is the relatively small size of the data and its distribution, which does not require using long-range context in most examples. Therefore, we leverage a strong language model that was pre-trained on large corpora as a fixed encoder which supplies additional contextualized token representations. We denote these representations as {o 1 , . . . , o k } and set</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">u t = [u t ; o t ] for {u 1 , . . . , u k } = BiLSTM(x 1 , . . . , x k ).</formula><p>The LM we use is from <ref type="bibr">Józefowicz et al. (2016)</ref>, 2 trained on the One Billion Words Benchmark dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Chelba et al., 2013)</ref>. It consists of an initial layer which produces character-based word representations, followed by two stacked LSTM layers and a softmax prediction layer. The hidden state outputs of each LSTM layer are projected down to a lower dimension via a bottleneck layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Sak et al., 2014</ref>). We set {o 1 , . . . , o k } to either the projections of the first layer, referred to as TR + LM(L1), or those of the second one, referred to as TR + LM(L2).</p><p>With both re-embedding schemes, we use the resulting representations w 1 , . . . , w k as a drop-in replacement for the word-embedding inputs fed to a standard model, described next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Base model</head><p>We build upon <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lee et al. (2016)</ref>, who proposed the RaSoR model. For word-embedding inputs q 1 , . . . , q m and p 1 , . . . , p n of dimension d w , RaSoR consists of the following components:</p><p>Passage-independent question representation The question is encoded via a BiLSTM {v 1 , . . . , v m } = BiLSTM(q 1 , . . . , q m ) and the resulting hidden states are summarized via attention ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al., 2015;</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">q indep = m j=1 α j v j ∈ R 2d h . The attention coefficients α are normalized log- its {α 1 , . . . , α m } = softmax(s 1 , . . . , s m ) where s j = w T q · FF(v j ) for a parameter vector w q ∈ R d f and FF(·) a single layer feed-forward network.</formula><p>Passage-aligned question representations For each passage position i, the question is encoded via attention operated over its word-embeddings</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">q align i = m j=1 β ij q j ∈ R dw .</formula><p>The coefficients β i are produced by normalizing the logits {s i1 , . . . , s im }, where s ij = FF(q j ) T · FF(p i ).</p></div>

Learning is performed by maximizing the log-likelihood of the correct answer span.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation and Analysis</head><p>We evaluate our contextualization scheme on the SQuAD dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rajpurkar et al., 2016</ref>) which consists of 100,000+ paragraph-question-answer examples, crowdsourced from Wikipedia articles.</p><p>Importance of context We are interested in evaluating the effect of our RNN-based reembedding scheme on the performance of the downstream base model. However, the addition of the re-embedding module incurs additional depth and capacity for the resultant model. We therefore compare this model, termed RaSoR + TR, to a setting in which re-embedding is non-contextual, referred to as RaSoR + TR(MLP). Here we set u t = MLP(x t ), a multi-layered perceptron on x t , allowing for the additional computation to be carried out on word-level representations without any context and matching the model size and hyperparameter search budget of RaSoR + TR. In <ref type="table">Table  1</ref> we compare these two variants over the development set and observe superior performance by the contextual one, illustrating the benefit of contextualization and specifically per-sequence contextualization which is done separately for the question and for the passage.</p><p>Context complements rare words Our formulation lends itself to an inspection of the different dynamic weightings computed by the model for interpolating between contextual and noncontextual terms. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> we plot the average gate value g t for each word-type, where the average is taken across entries of the gate vector and across all occurrences of the word in both passages <ref type="bibr">Model</ref> </p></div>

The EM metric measures an exact-match between a predicted answer and a correct one and the F1 metric measures the overlap between their bag of words. and questions. This inspection reveals the following: On average, the less frequent a word-type is, the smaller are its gate activations, i.e., the reembedded representation of a rare word places less weight on its fixed word-embedding and more on its contextual representation, compared to a common word. This highlights a problem with maintaining fixed word representations: albeit pretrained on extremely large corpora, the embeddings of rare words need to be complemented with information emanating from their context. Our specific parameterization allows observing this directly, but it may very well be an implicit burden placed on any contextualizing encoder such as a vanilla BiLSTM.</p></div>

Overall, we observe a significant improvement with all three configurations, effectively showing the benefit of training a QA model in a semisupervised fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dai and Le, 2015)</ref> with a large language model. Besides a crosscutting boost in results, we note that the performance due to utilizing the LM hidden states of the first LSTM layer significantly surpasses the other two variants. This may be due to context being most strongly represented in those hidden states as the representations of LM(emb) are non-contextual by definition and those of LM(L2) were optimized (during LM training) to be similar to parameter vectors that correspond to word-types and not to word-tokens.</p><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 2</ref> we list the top-scoring single-model published results on SQuAD's test set, where we observe RaSoR + TR + LM(L1) ranks second in EM, despite having only minimal questionpassage interaction which is a core component of other works.

(2016) [5] Lee et al. (2016) [6] Shen et al. (2017) [7] Zhang et al. (2017) 5 Experimental setup We use pre-trained GloVe embeddings (Penning- ton et al., 2014) of dimension d w = 300 and produce character-based word representations via d c = 100 convolutional filters over character embeddings as in Seo et al. (2016). For all BiLSTMs, hyper-parameter search included the following values, with model selection being done according to validation set results (underlined): number of stacked BiLSTM layers (1, 2, 3), num- ber of cells d h (50, 100, 200), dropout rate over input (0.4, 0.5, 0.6), dropout rate over hidden state (0.05, 0.1, 0.15). To further regularize models, we employed word dropout (Iyyer et al., 2015; Dai and Le, 2015) at rate (0.05, 0.1, 0.15) and cou- ple LSTM input and forget gate as in Greff et al. (2016). All feed-forward networks and the MLP employed the ReLU non-linearity (Nair and Hin- ton, 2010) with dropout rate (0.2, 0.3), where the single hidden layer of the FFs was of dimension d f = (50, 100) and the best performing MLP consisted of 3 hidden layers of dimensions 865, 865 and 400. For optimization, we used Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with batch size 80.</figDesc></figure>
