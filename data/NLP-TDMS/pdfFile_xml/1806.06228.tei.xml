				<p>Multimodal sentiment analysis is a very actively growing field of research. A promising area of opportunity in this field is to improve the multimodal fusion mechanism. We present a novel feature fusion strategy that proceeds in a hierarchical fashion, first fusing the modalities two in two and only then fusing all three modalities. On multimodal sentiment analysis of individual utterances, our strategy outperforms conventional concatenation of features by 1%, which amounts to 5% reduction in error rate. On utterance-level multimodal sentiment analysis of multi-utterance video clips, for which current state-of-the-art techniques incorporate contextual information from other utterances of the same clip, our hierarchical fusion gives up to 2.4% (almost 10% error rate reduction) over currently used concatenation. The implementation of our method is publicly available in the form of open-source code.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>In recent years, sentiment analysis has become increasingly popular for processing social media data on online communities, blogs, wikis, microblogging platforms, and other online collaborative media <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Sentiment analysis is a branch of affective computing research <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> that aims to classify text -but sometimes also audio and video <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> -into either positive or negative -but sometimes also neutral <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Most of the literature is on English language but recently an increasing number of works are tackling the multilinguality issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, especially in booming online languages such as Chinese <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Sentiment analysis techniques can be broadly categorized into symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches: the former include the use of lexicons <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, ontologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and semantic networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> to encode the polarity associated with words and multiword expressions; the latter consist of supervised <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, semi-supervised <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and unsupervised <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> machine learning techniques that perform sentiment classification based on word cooccurrence frequencies. Among these, the most popular recently are algorithms based on deep neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and generative adversarial networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>While most works approach it as a simple categorization problem, sentiment analysis is actually a suitcase research problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> that requires tackling many NLP tasks, including word polarity disambiguation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, subjectivity detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, personality recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, microtext normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, concept extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, time tagging <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and aspect extraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Sentiment analysis has raised growing interest both within the scientific community, leading to many exciting open challenges, as well as in the business world, due to the remarkable benefits to be had from financial <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and political <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> forecasting, e-health <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and e-tourism <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, user profiling <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and community detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, manufacturing and supply chain applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, human communication comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and dialogue systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, etc.</p><p>In the field of emotion recognition, early works by De Silva et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> showed that fusion of audio and visual systems, creating a bimodal signal, yielded a higher accuracy than any unimodal system. Such fusion has been analyzed at both feature level <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and decision level <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Although there is much work done on audio-visual fusion for emotion recognition, exploring contribution of text along with audio and visual modalities in multimodal emotion detection has been little explored. Wollmer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Rozgic et al. [39]</ref> fused information from audio, visual and textual modalities to extract emotion and sentiment. <ref type="bibr">Metallinou et al. [40]</ref> and Eyben et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[41]</ref> fused audio and textual modalities for emotion recognition. Both approaches relied on a feature-level fusion. Wu and Liang <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[42]</ref> fused audio and textual clues at decision level. Poria et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref> uses convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the modalities and then employs multiple-kernel learning (MKL) for sentiment analysis. The current state of the art, set forth by Poria et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, extracts contextual information from the surrounding utterances using long short-term memory (LSTM). Poria et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> fuses different modalities with deep learning-based tools. Zadeh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref> uses tensor fusion. Poria et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[45]</ref> further extends upon the ensemble of CNN and MKL.</p><p>Unlike existing approaches, which use simple concatenation based early fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">46]</ref> and non-trainable tensors based fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref>, this work proposes a hierarchical fusion capable of learning the bimodal and trimodal correlations for data fusion using deep neural networks. The method is end-to-end and, in order to accomplish the fusion, it can be plugged into any deep neural network based multimodal sentiment analysis framework.</p></div>

The problem with this simplistic approach is that it cannot filter out and conflicting or redundant information obtained from different modalities. To address this major issue, we devise an hierarchical approach which proceeds from unimodal to bimodal vectors and then bimodal to trimodal vectors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Textual Feature Extraction</head><p>The textual data is obtained from the transcripts of the videos. We apply a with 50 feature maps each and the second layer has a filter of size 2 with 100 feature maps. Each convolutional layer is followed by a max-pooling layer with window 2 × 2.</p><p>The output of the second max-pooling layer is fed to a fully-connected layer with 500 neurons with a rectified linear unit (ReLU) <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[49]</ref> activation, followed by softmax output. The output of the penultimate fully-connected layer is used as the textual feature. The translation of convolution filter over makes the CNN learn abstract features and with each subsequent layer the context of the features expands further.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Audio Feature Extraction</head><p>The audio feature extraction process is performed at 30 Hz frame rate with 100 ms sliding window. We use openSMILE <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[50]</ref>, which is capable of automatic pitch and voice intensity extraction, for audio feature extraction. Prior to feature extraction audio signals are processed with voice intensity thresholding and voice normalization. Specifically, we use Z-standardization for voice normaliza- inter-quartile ranges, and linear regression slope). "IS13-ComParE" configuration file of openSMILE is used to for our purposes. Finally, we extracted total 6392 features from each input audio segment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3.">Visual Feature Extraction</head><p>To extract visual features, we focus not only on feature extraction from each video frame but also try to model temporal features across frames.

Its state-of-the-art performance on such tasks motivates its use in this paper.</p><p>Let the video be called vid ∈ R 3×f ×h×w , where 3 represents the three RGB channels of an image and f, h, and w denote the cardinality, height, and width of the frames, respectively. A 3D convolutional filter, named f lt ∈ R fm×3×f d ×f h ×fw , is applied to this video, where, similar to a 2D-CNN, the fil-ter translates across the video and generates the convolution output conv out ∈</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">R fm×3×(f −f d +1)×(h−f h +1)×(w−fw+1)</formula><p>. Here, f m , f d , f h , and f w denote number of feature maps, depth of filter, height of filter, and width of filter, respectively.</p><p>Finally, we apply max-pooling operation to the conv out , which selects the most relevant features. This operation is applied only to the last three dimensions of conv out . This is followed by a dense layer and softmax computation. The activations of this layer is used as the overall video features for each utterance video.</p><p>In our experiments, we receive the best results with filter dimensions f m = 32</p><p>and f d , f h , f w = 5. Also, for the max-pooling, we set the window size as 3×3×3</p><p>and the succeeding dense layer with 300 neurons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Context Modeling</head><p>Utterances in the videos are semantically dependent on each other. In other words, complete meaning of an utterance may be determined by taking preceding utterances into consideration.

Followed by support vector machine (SVM) being applied on this feature vector for the final sentiment classification.</p><p>Method from <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>. We have implemented and compared our method with the approach proposed by Poria et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>. In their approach, they extracted visual features using CLM-Z, audio features using openSMILE, and textual features using CNN. MKL was then applied to the features obtained from concatenation of the unimodal features. However, they did not conduct speaker independent experiments.</p><p>In order to perform a fair comparison with <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>, we employ our fusion method on the features extracted by Poria et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>.</p><p>Method from <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. We have compared our method with <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref>, which takes advantage of contextual information obtained from the surrounding utterances. This context modeling is achieved using LSTM. We reran the experiments of Poria et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[46]</ref> without using SVM for classification since using SVM with neural networks is usually discouraged. This provides a fair comparison with our model which does not use SVM.</p><p>Method from <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref>, they proposed a trimodal fusion method based on the tensors. We have also compared our method with their. In particular, their dataset configuration was different than us so we have adapted their publicly available code 5 and employed that on our dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Experimental Setting</head><p>We considered two variants of experimental setup while evaluating our model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HFusion. In this setup, we evaluated hierarchical fusion without context-aware</head><p>features with CMU-MOSI dataset. We removed all the GRUs from the model described in Sections 3.3 and 3.4 forwarded utterance specific features directly to the next layer. This setup is depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>.</p><p>CHFusion. This setup is exactly as the model described in Section 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Results and Discussion</head><p>We discuss the results for the different experimental settings discussed in Section 4.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1.">Hierarchical Fusion (HFusion)</head><p>The results of our experiments are presented in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. We evaluated this setup with CMU-MOSI dataset (Section 4.1.1) and two feature sets: the feature set used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref> and the set of unimodal features discussed in Section 3.2. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Comparison in terms of accuracy of Hierarchical Fusion (HFusion) with other fusion methods for CMU-MOSI dataset; bold font signifies best accuracy for the corresponding feature set and modality or modalities, where T stands for text, V for video, and A for audio. SOT A 1 = Poria et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>, SOT A 2 = Zadeh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref> Modality Combination <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>  Our model outperformed <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>, which employed MKL, for all bimodal and trimodal scenarios by a margin of 1-1.8%. This leads us to present two observations. Firstly, the features used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref> are inferior to the features extracted in our approach. Second, our hierarchical fusion method is better than their fusion method.</p><p>It is already established in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">56]</ref> that multimodal analysis outperforms unimodal analysis. We also observe the same trend in our experiments where trimodal and bimodal classifiers outperform unimodal classifiers.</p><p>The textual modality performed best among others with a higher unimodal classification accuracy of 75%. Although other modalities contribute to improve the performance of multimodal classifiers, that contribution is little in compare to the textual modality.</p><p>On the other hand, we compared our model with early fusion (Section 4.2) for aforementioned feature sets (Section 3.2). Our fusion mechanism consistently outperforms early fusion for all combination of modalities. This supports our hypothesis that our hierarchical fusion method captures the inter-relation among the modalities and produce better performance vector than early fusion. Text is the strongest individual modality, and we observe that the text modality paired with remaining two modalities results in consistent performance improvement.</p><p>Overall, the results give a strong indication that the comparison among the abstract feature values dampens the effect of less important modalities, which was our hypothesis. For example, we can notice that for early fusion T+V and T+A both yield the same performance. However, with our method text with video performs better than text with audio, which is more aligned with our expectations, since facial muscle movements usually carry more emotional nuances than voice.</p><p>In particular, we observe that our model outperformed all the strong baselines mentioned above. The method by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref> is only able to fuse using concatenation. Our proposed method outperformed their approach by a significant margin; thanks to the power of hierarchical fusion which proves the capability of our method in modeling bimodal and trimodal correlations. However on the other hand, the method by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref> is capable of fusing the modalities using a tensor. Interestingly our method also outperformed them and we think the reason is the capability of bimodal fusion and use that for trimodal fusion.</p><p>Tensor fusion network is incapable to learn the weights of the bimodal and trimodal correlations in the fusion. Tensor Fusion is mathematically formed by an outer product, it has no learn-able parameters. Wherein our method learns the weights automatically using a neural network (Equation 1,2 and 3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.2.">Context-Aware Hierarchical Fusion (CHFusion)</head><p>The results of this experiment are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>. This setting fully utilizes the model described in Section 3. We applied this experimental setting for two datasets, namely CMU-MOSI (Section 4.1.1) and IEMOCAP (Section 4.1.2).</p><p>We used the feature set discussed in Section 3.2, which was also used by Poria et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. As expected our method outperformed the simple early fusion based fusion by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>, tensor fusion by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref>. The method by Poria et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> used a scheme to learn contextual features from the surrounding features. However, as a method of fusion they adapted simple concatenation based fusion method by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[43]</ref>. As discussed in Section 3.3, we employed their contextual feature extraction framework and integrated our proposed fusion method to that. This has helped us to outperform Poria et al.</p><p>[1] by significant margin thanks to the hierarchical fusion (HFusion).</p><p>CMU-MOSI. We achieve 1-2% performance improvement over the state of the art <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for all the modality combinations having textual component. For A+V modality combination we achieve better but similar performance to the state of the art. We suspect that it is due to both audio and video modality being significantly less informative than textual modality. It is evident from the unimodal performance where we observe that textual modality on its own performs around 21% better than both audio and video modality. Also, audio and video modality performs close to majority baseline. On the other hand, it is important to notice that with all modalities combined we achieve about 3.5% higher accuracy than text alone.</p><p>For example, consider the following utterance: so overall new moon even with the bigger better budgets huh it was still too long. The speaker discusses her opinion on the movie Twilight New Moon. Textually the utterance is abundant with positive words however audio and video comprises of a frown which is observed by the hierarchical fusion based model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IEMOCAP.</head><p>As the IEMOCAP dataset contains four distinct emotion categories, in the last layer of the network we used a softmax classifier whose out- put dimension is set to 4. In order to perform classification on IEMOCAP dataset we feed the fused features F mt (where m = AV, V T, T A, or AV T and t = 1, 2, . . . , N ) to a softmax layer with C = 4 outputs. The classifier can be described as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">P = softmax(W softmax F mt + b softmax ), ˆ y = argmax j (P[j]),</formula><p>where W softmax ∈ R 4×D , b softmax ∈ R 4 , P ∈ R 4 , j = class value (0 or 1 or 2 or 3), andˆyandˆ andˆy = estimated class value.</p><p>Here as well, we achieve performance improvement consistent with CMU-MOSI. This method performs 1-2.4% better than the state of the art for all the modality combinations. Also, trimodal accuracy is 3% higher than the same for textual modality. Since, IEMOCAP dataset imbalanced, we also present the f-score for each modality combination for a better evaluation. One key observation for IEMOCAP dataset is that its A+V modality combination performs significantly better than the same of CMU-MOSI dataset. We think that this is due to the audio and video modality of IEMOCAP being richer than the same of CMU-MOSI. The performance difference with another strong baseline <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref> is even more ranging from 2.1% to 3% on CMU-MOSI dataset and 2.2% to 5% on IEMOCAP dataset. This again confirms the superiority of the hierarchical fusion in compare to <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[44]</ref>. We think this is mainly because of learning the weights of bimodal and trimodal correlation (representing the degree of correlations)</p><p>calculations at the time of fusion while Tensor Fusion Network (TFN) just relies on the non-trainable outer product of tensors to model such correlations for fusion. Additionally, we present class-wise accuracy and f-score for IEMOCAP for trimodal (A+V+T) scenario in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.3.">HFusion vs. CHFusion</head><p>We compare HFusion and CHFusion models over CMU-MOSI dataset. We observe that CHFusion performs 1-2% better than HFusion model for all the modality combinations. This performance boost is achieved by the inclusion of utterance-level contextual information in HFusion model by adding GRUs in different levels of fusion hierarchy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>Multimodal fusion strategy is an important issue in multimodal sentiment analysis. However, little work has been done so far in this direction. In this paper, we have presented a novel and comprehensive fusion strategy. Our method outperforms the widely used early fusion on both datasets typically used to test multimodal sentiment analysis methods. Moreover, with the addition of context modeling with GRU, our method outperforms the state of the art in multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion detection by significant margin.</p><p>In our future work, we plan to improve the quality of unimodal features, especially textual features, which will further improve the accuracy of classification. We will also experiment with more sophisticated network architectures.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Utterance-level early fusion, or simple concatenation</figDesc></figure>

Also, in g x the rows represent the utterances and the columns the feature val- ues. We can see these values c x lt as more abstract feature values derived from fundamental feature values (which are the components of f A , f V , and f T ). For example, an abstract feature can be the angriness of a speaker in a video. We can infer the degree of angriness from visual features (f V ; facial muscle move- ments), acoustic features (f A , such as pitch and raised voice), or textual features (f T , such as the language and choice of words). Therefore, the degree of angri- ness can be represented by c x lt , where x is A, V , or T , l is some fixed integer between 1 and D, and t is some fixed integer between 1 and N . Now, the evaluation of abstract feature values from all the modalities may not have the same merit or may even contradict each other. Hence, we need the network to make comparison among the feature values derived from different modalities to make a more refined evaluation of the degree of anger. To this end, we take each bimodal combination (which are audio-video, audio-text, and video-text) at a time and compare and combine each of their respective abstract feature values (i.e. c V lt with c T lt , c V lt with c A lt , and c A lt with c T lt ) using fully-connected layers as follows:</figDesc></figure>

To this end, we perform person-independent experiments to emulate unseen conditions. Our train/test splits of the dataset are completely disjoint with respect to speakers.
