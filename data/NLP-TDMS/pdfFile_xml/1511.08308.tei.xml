				<p>Named entity recognition is a challenging task that has traditionally required large amounts of knowledge in the form of feature engineering and lexicons to achieve high performance. In this paper, we present a novel neural network architecture that automatically detects word-and character-level features using a hybrid bidirectional LSTM and CNN architecture , eliminating the need for most feature engineering. We also propose a novel method of encoding partial lexicon matches in neu-ral networks and compare it to existing approaches. Extensive evaluation shows that, given only tokenized text and publicly available word embeddings, our system is competitive on the CoNLL-2003 dataset and surpasses the previously reported state of the art performance on the OntoNotes 5.0 dataset by 2.13 F1 points. By using two lexicons constructed from publicly-available sources, we establish new state of the art performance with an F1 score of 91.62 on CoNLL-2003 and 86.28 on OntoNotes, surpassing systems that employ heavy feature engineering, proprietary lexicons, and rich entity linking information.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Named entity recognition is an important task in NLP. High performance approaches have been dominated by applying CRF, SVM, or perceptron models to hand-crafted features <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ratinov and Roth, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Passos et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Luo et al., 2015</ref>). However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011b)</ref> proposed an effective neural network model that requires little feature engineering and instead learns important features from word embeddings trained on large quantities of unlabelled text -an approach made possible by recent advancements in unsupervised learning of word embeddings on massive amounts of data <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Collobert and Weston, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) and neural network training algorithms permitting deep architectures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rumelhart et al., 1986)</ref>.</p><p>Unfortunately there are many limitations to the model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011b)</ref>. First, it uses a simple feed-forward neural network, which restricts the use of context to a fixed sized window around each word -an approach that discards useful long-distance relations between words. Second, by depending solely on word embeddings, it is unable to exploit explicit character level features such as prefix and suffix, which could be useful especially with rare words where word embeddings are poorly trained. We seek to address these issues by proposing a more powerful neural network model. A well-studied solution for a neural network to process variable length input and have long term memory is the recurrent neural network (RNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Goller and Kuchler, 1996)</ref>. Recently, RNNs have shown great success in diverse NLP tasks such as speech recognition ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Graves et al., 2013</ref>), machine translation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Cho et al., 2014)</ref>, and language modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Mikolov et al., 2011</ref>). The long-short term memory (LSTM) unit with the forget gate allows highly non-trivial long-distance dependencies to be easily learned ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gers et al., 2000</ref>). For sequential labelling tasks such as NER and speech recognition, a bi-directional LSTM model can take into account an effectively infinite amount of context on both sides of a word and eliminates the problem of limited context that applies to any feed-forward model ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Graves et al., 2013)</ref>. While LSTMs have been studied in the past for the NER task by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hammerton (2003)</ref>, the lack of computational power (which led to the use of very small models) and quality word embeddings limited their effectiveness.</p><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have also been investigated for modeling character-level information, among other NLP tasks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Santos et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Labeau et al. (2015)</ref> successfully employed CNNs to extract character-level features for use in NER and POS-tagging respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011b)</ref> also applied CNNs to semantic role labeling, and variants of the architecture have been applied to parsing and other tasks requiring tree structures ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Blunsom et al., 2014</ref>). However, the effectiveness of character-level CNNs has not been evaluated for English NER. While we considered using character-level bi-directional LSTMs, which was recently proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Ling et al. (2015)</ref> for POStagging, preliminary evaluation shows that it does not perform significantly better than CNNs while being more computationally expensive to train.</p><p>Our main contribution lies in combining these neural network models for the NER task. We present a hybrid model of bi-directional LSTMs and CNNs  that learns both character-and word-level features, presenting the first evaluation of such an architecture on well-established English language evaluation datasets. Furthermore, as lexicons are crucial to NER performance, we propose a new lexicon encoding scheme and matching algorithm that can make use of partial matches, and we compare it to the simpler approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011b)</ref>. Extensive evaluation shows that our proposed method establishes a new state of the art on both the CoNLL-2003 NER shared task and the OntoNotes 5.0 datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Model</head><p>Our neural network is inspired by the work of <ref type="bibr">Col- lobert et al. (2011b)</ref>, where lookup tables transform discrete features such as words and characters into continuous vector representations, which are then concatenated and fed into a neural network. Instead of a feed-forward network, we use the bi-directional long-short term memory (BLSTM) network. To induce character-level features, we use a convolutional neural network, which has been successfully applied to Spanish and Portuguese NER ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Santos et al., 2015)</ref> and German POS-tagging ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Labeau et al., 2015</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Sequence-labelling with BLSTM</head><p>Following the speech-recognition framework outlined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Graves et al. (2013)</ref>, we employed a stacked 1 bi-directional recurrent neural network with long short-term memory units to transform word features into named entity tag scores. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures  1, 2</ref>, and 3 illustrate the network in detail. The extracted features of each word are fed into a forward LSTM network and a backward LSTM network. The output of each network at each time step is decoded by a linear layer and a log-softmax layer into log-probabilities for each tag category. These two vectors are then simply added together to produce the final output.</p><p>We tried minor variants of output layer architecture and selected the one that performed the best in preliminary experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Extracting Character Features Using a Convolutional Neural Network</head><p>For each word we employ a convolution and a max layer to extract a new feature vector from the percharacter feature vectors such as character embeddings (Section 2.3.2) and (optionally) character type (Section 2.5). Words are padded with a number of special PADDING characters on both sides depending on the window size of the CNN. The hyper-parameters of the CNN are the window size and the output vector size. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> For each direction (forward and backward), the input is fed into multiple layers of LSTM units connected in sequence (i.e. LSTM units in the second layer take in the output of the first layer, and so on); the number of layers is a tuned hyperparameter. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows only one unit for simplicity.  </p></div>

In addition, for each entry we first removed parentheses and all text contained within, then stripped trailing punctuation, <ref type="bibr">15</ref> and finally tokenized it with the Penn Treebank tokenization script for the purpose of partial matching. Table 1 shows the size of each category in our lexicon compared to Collobert's lexicon, which we extracted from their SENNA system. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref> shows an example of how the lexicon features are applied. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> For each lexicon category, we match every n-gram (up to the length of the longest lexicon entry) against entries in the lexicon. A match is successful when the n-gram matches the prefix or suffix of an entry and is at least half the length of the entry. Because of the high potential for spurious matches, for all categories except Person, we discard partial matches less than 2 tokens in length. When there are multiple overlapping matches within the same category, we prefer exact matches over partial matches, and then longer matches over shorter matches, and finally earlier matches in the sentence over later matches. All matches are case insensitive.</p><p>For each token in the match, the feature is en-  coded in BIOES annotation (Begin, Inside, Outside, End, Single), indicating the position of the token in the matched entry. In other words, B will not appear in a suffix-only partial match, and E will not appear in a prefix-only partial match.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Hyper-parameter CoNLL-2003 (Round 2) OntoNotes 5.0 (Round 1) Final Range Final Range Convolution width 3 [3, 7] 3 [3, 9] CNN output size 53 [15, 84] 20 [15, 100] LSTM state size 275 [100, 500] 200 [100, 400] 10 LSTM layers 1 [1, 4] 2 [2, 4] Learning rate 0.0105 [10 −3 , 10 −1.8 ] 0.008 [10 −3.5 , 10 −1.5 ] Epochs 11 80 - 18 - Dropout 12 0.68 [0.25, 0.75] 0.63 [0, 1] Mini-batch size 9 -13 9 [5, 14]</formula><p>As we will see in Section 4.5, we found that this more sophisticated method outperforms the method presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Excluding Failed Trials</head><p>On the CoNLL-2003 dataset, while BLSTM models completed training without difficulty, the BLSTM-CNN models fail to converge around 5∼10% of the time depending on feature set. Similarly, on OntoNotes, 1.5% of trials fail. We found that using a lower learning rate reduces failure rate. We also tried clipping gradients and using AdaDelta and both of them were effective at eliminating such failures by themselves. AdaDelta, however, made training more expensive with no gain in model performance.</p><p>In any case, for all experiments we excluded trials where the final F1 score on a subset of training data falls below a certain threshold, and continued to run trials until we obtained 10 successful ones.</p><p>For CoNLL-2003, we excluded trials where the final F1 score on the development set was less than 95; there was no ambiguity in selecting the threshold as every trial scored either above 98 or below 90. For OntoNotes, the threshold was a F1 score of 80 on the last 5,000 sentences of the training set; every trial scored either above 80 or below 75.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Training and Tagging Speed</head><p>On an Intel Xeon E5-2697 processor, training takes about 6 hours while tagging the test set takes about 12 seconds for CoNLL-2003. The times are 10 hours and 60 seconds respectively for OntoNotes. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> shows the results for all datasets. To the best of our knowledge, our best models have surpassed the previous highest reported F1 scores for both <ref type="bibr">CoNLL-2003 and OntoNotes.</ref> In particular, with no external knowledge other than word embeddings, our model is competitive on the CoNLL-2003 dataset and establishes a new state of the art for OntoNotes, suggesting that given enough data, the neural network automatically learns the relevant features for NER without feature engineering.</p></div>

(2011b)</ref> as a baseline for comparison. Table 5 shows that while performing reasonably well on CoNLL-2003, FFNNs are clearly inadequate for OntoNotes, which has a larger domain, showing that LSTM models are essential for NER.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Character-level CNNs vs. Character Type and Capitalization Features</head><p>The comparison of models in <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref> shows that on CoNLL-2003, BLSTM-CNN models significantly <ref type="bibr">26</ref> outperform the BLSTM models when given the same feature set. This effect is smaller and not statistically significant on OntoNotes when capitalization features are added. Adding character type and capitalization features to the BLSTM-CNN models degrades performance for CoNLL and mostly improves performance on OntoNotes, suggesting character-level CNNs can replace hand-crafted character features in some cases, but systems with weak lexicons may benefit from character features.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">-2003  OntoNotes 5.0  Dev  Test  Dev  Test  -</ref> 93.72 (± 0.10) 90.76 (± 0.22) 82.02 (± 0.49) 84.06 (± 0.50) 0.10 93.85 (± 0.18) 90.87 (± 0.31) 83.01 (± 0.39) 84.94 (± 0.25) 0. <ref type="bibr">30</ref> 94.08 (± 0.17) 91.09 (± 0.18) 83.61 (± 0.32) 85.44 (± 0.33) 0.50 94.19 (± 0.18) 91.14 (± 0.35) 84.35 (± 0.23) 86.36 (± 0.28) 0.63 --84.47 (± 0.23) 86.29 (± 0.25) 0.68 94.31 (± 0.15) 91.23 (± 0.16) --0.70 94.31 (± 0.24) 91.17 (± 0.37) 84.56 (± 0.40) 86.17 (± 0.25) 0.90 94.17 (± 0.17) 90.67 (± 0.17) 81.38 (± 0.19) 82.16 (± 0.18)  <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> and <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> show that we obtain a large, significant 27 improvement when trained word embeddings are used, as opposed to random embeddings, regardless of the additional features used. This is consistent with Collobert et. al. (2011b)'s results. <ref type="table">Table 7</ref> compares the performance of different word embeddings in our best model in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> (BLSTM-CNN + emb + lex). For CoNLL-2003, the publicly available GloVe and Google embeddings are about one point behind Collobert's embeddings. For OntoNotes, GloVe embeddings perform close to Collobert embeddings while Google embeddings are again one point behind. In addition, 300 dimensional embeddings present no significant improvement over 50 dimensional embeddings -a result previously reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Turian et al. (2010)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Word Embeddings</head><p>One possible reason that Collobert embeddings perform better than other publicly available embeddings on CoNLL-2003 is that they are trained on the Reuters RCV-1 corpus, the source of the CoNLL-2003 dataset, whereas the other embeddings are not <ref type="bibr">28</ref> . On the other hand, we suspect that Google's embeddings perform poorly because of vocabulary mismatch -in particular, Google's embeddings were trained in a case-sensitive manner, and embeddings for many common punctuations and <ref type="bibr">27</ref> Wilcoxon rank sum test, p &lt; 0.001 <ref type="bibr">28</ref> To make a direct comparison to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011b)</ref>, we do not exclude the CoNLL-2003 NER task test data from the word vector training data. While it is possible that this difference could be responsible for the disparate performance of word vectors, the CoNLL-2003 training data comprises only 20k out of 800 million words, or 0.00002% of the total data; in an unsupervised training scheme, the effects are likely negligible. symbols were not provided. To test these hypotheses, we performed experiments with new word embeddings trained using GloVe and word2vec, with vocabulary list and corpus similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et. al. (2011b)</ref>. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>, our GloVe embeddings improved significantly 29 over publicly available embeddings on CoNLL-2003, and our word2vec skip-gram embeddings improved significantly 30 over Google's embeddings on OntoNotes.</p><p>Due to time constraints we did not perform new hyper-parameter searches with any of the word embeddings. As word embedding quality depends on hyper-parameter choice during their training <ref type="bibr">(Pen- nington et al., 2014)</ref>, and also, in our NER neural network, hyper-parameter choice is likely sensitive to the type of word embeddings used, optimizing them all will likely produce better results and provide a fairer comparison of word embedding quality. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 8</ref> compares the result of various dropout values for each dataset. The models are trained using only the training set for each dataset to isolate the effect of dropout on both dev and test sets. All other hyper-parameters and features remain the same as our best model in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>. In both datasets and on both dev and test sets, dropout is essential for state of the art performance, and the improvement is statistically significant <ref type="bibr">31</ref> . Dropout is optimized on the dev set, as described in Section 3.4. Hence, the chosen <ref type="bibr">29</ref> Wilcoxon rank sum test, p &lt; 0.01 <ref type="bibr">30</ref> Wilcoxon rank sum test, p &lt; 0.01 <ref type="bibr">31</ref> Wilcoxon rank sum test, no dropout vs. best setting: p &lt; 0.001 for the CoNLL-2003 test set, p &lt; 0.0001 for the OntoNotes 5.0 test set, p &lt; 0.0005 for all others.  <ref type="table">Not NE  CARDINAL   DATE  MONEY  ORDINAL  PERCENT  QUALITY   TIME  LOC  FAC  GPE  NORP  ORG  PERSON  EVENT  LANG  LAW  PRODUCT   WORK  Non-</ref> value may not be the best-performing in <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 8</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 6</ref> shows that on the CoNLL-2003 dataset, using features from both the SENNA lexicon and our proposed DBpedia lexicon provides a significant 32 improvement and allows our model to clearly surpass the previous state of the art. Unfortunately the difference is minuscule for OntoNotes, most likely because our lexicon does not match DBpedia categories well. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 5</ref> shows that on CoNLL-2003, lexicon coverage is reasonable and matches the tags set for everything except the catchall MISC category. For example, LOC entries in lexicon match mostly LOC named entities and vice versa. However, on OntoNotes, the matches are noisy and correspondence between lexicon match and tag category is quite ambiguous. For example, all lexicon categories have spurious matches in unrelated named entities like CARDINAL, and LOC, GPE, and LANGUAGE entities all get a lot of matches from the LOC category in the lexicon. In addition, named entities in categories like NORP, ORG, LAW, PRODUCT receive little coverage. The lower coverage, noise, and ambiguity all contribute to the disappointing performance. This suggests that the DBpedia lexicon construction method needs to be improved. A reasonable place to start would be the DBpedia category to OntoNotes NE tag mappings.</p></div>

In this weakened model, both lexicons contribute significant 33 improvements over the baseline.</p><p>Compared to the SENNA lexicon, our DBpedia lexicon is noisier but has broader coverage, which explains why when applying it using the same method as <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al. (2011b)</ref>, it performs worse on CoNLL-2003 but better on OntoNotesa dataset containing many more obscure named entities. However, we suspect that the method of <ref type="bibr">Col- lobert et al. (2011b)</ref> is not noise resistant and therefore unsuitable for our lexicon because it fails to distinguish exact and partial matches <ref type="bibr">34</ref> and does not set a minimum length for partial matching. <ref type="bibr">35</ref> Instead, when we apply our superior partial matching algorithm and BIOES encoding with our DBpedia lexicon, we gain a significant 36 improvement, allowing our lexicon to perform similarly to the SENNA lexicon. Unfortunately, as we could not reliably remove partial entries from the SENNA lexicon, we were unable to investigate whether or not our lexicon matching method would help in that lexicon.</p><p>In addition, using both lexicons together as distinct features provides a further improvement 37 on CoNLL-2003, which we suspect is because the lexi- <ref type="bibr">33</ref> Wilcoxon rank sum test, p &lt; 0.05 for SENNA-Exact-BIOES, p &lt; 0.005 for all others. <ref type="bibr">34</ref> We achieve this by using BIOES encoding and prioritizing exact matches over partial matches. <ref type="bibr">35</ref> Matching only the first word of a long entry is not very useful; this is not a problem in the SENNA lexicon because 99% of its entries contain only 3 tokens or less. <ref type="bibr">36</ref> Wilcoxon rank sum test, p &lt; 0.001. <ref type="bibr">37</ref> Wilcoxon rank sum test, p &lt; 0.001.</p></div>

As expected, our model performs best on clean text like broadcast news (BN) and newswire (NW), and worst on noisy text like telephone conversation (TC) and Web text (WB). Our model also substantially improves over previous work on all genres except TC, where the small size of the training data likely hinders learning.
