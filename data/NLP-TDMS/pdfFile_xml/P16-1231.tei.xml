				<p>We introduce a globally normalized transition-based neural network model that achieves state-of-the-art part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing and sentence compression results. Our model is a simple feed-forward neural network that operates on a task-specific transition system, yet achieves comparable or better accuracies than recurrent models. We discuss the importance of global as opposed to local normalization: a key insight is that the label bias problem implies that globally normalized models can be strictly more expressive than locally normalized models.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Neural network approaches have taken the field of natural language processing (NLP) by storm. In particular, variants of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks (Hochreiter and <ref type="bibr">Schmidhu- ber, 1997</ref>) have produced impressive results on some of the classic NLP tasks such as part-ofspeech tagging ( , syntactic parsing ( <ref type="bibr">Vinyals et al., 2015</ref>) and semantic role labeling ( <ref type="bibr">Zhou and Xu, 2015)</ref>. One might speculate that it is the recurrent nature of these models that enables these results.</p><p>In this work we demonstrate that simple feedforward networks without any recurrence can achieve comparable or better accuracies than LSTMs, as long as they are globally normalized. Our model, described in detail in Section 2, uses a transition system <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Nivre, 2006</ref>) and feature embeddings as introduced by <ref type="bibr">Chen and Manning (2014)</ref>. We do not use any recurrence, but perform beam search for maintaining multiple hy- * On leave from Columbia University. potheses and introduce global normalization with a conditional random field (CRF) objective <ref type="bibr">(Bot- tou et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Le Cun et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lafferty et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Collobert et al., 2011</ref>) to overcome the label bias problem that locally normalized models suffer from. Since we use beam inference, we approximate the partition function by summing over the elements in the beam, and use early updates ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Collins and Roark, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2015)</ref>. We compute gradients based on this approximate global normalization and perform full backpropagation training of all neural network parameters based on the CRF loss.</p><p>In Section 3 we revisit the label bias problem and the implication that globally normalized models are strictly more expressive than locally normalized models. Lookahead features can partially mitigate this discrepancy, but cannot fully compensate for it-a point to which we return later. To empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of global normalization, we evaluate our model on part-of-speech tagging, syntactic dependency parsing and sentence compression (Section 4). Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on all of these tasks, matching or outperforming LSTMs while being significantly faster. In particular for dependency parsing on the Wall Street Journal we achieve the best-ever published unlabeled attachment score of 94.61%.</p><p>As discussed in more detail in Section 5, we also outperform previous structured training approaches used for neural network transition-based parsing. Our ablation experiments show that we outperform <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Weiss et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alberti et al. (2015)</ref> because we do global backpropagation training of all model parameters, while they fix the neural network parameters when training the global part of their model. We also outperform <ref type="bibr">Zhou et al. (2015)</ref> despite using a smaller beam. To shed additional light on the label bias problem in practice, we provide a sentence compression example where the local model completely fails. We then demonstrate that a globally normalized parsing model without any lookahead features is almost as accurate as our best model, while a locally normalized model loses more than 10% absolute in accuracy because it cannot effectively incorporate evidence as it becomes available.</p><p>Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of our method, called SyntaxNet, 1 which we have integrated into the popular TensorFlow 2 framework.</p><p>We also provide a pre-trained, state-of-the art English dependency parser called "Parsey McParseface," which we tuned for a balance of speed, simplicity, and accuracy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Transition System</head><p>Given an input x, most often a sentence, we define:</p><p>• A set of states S(x).</p><p>• A special start state s † ∈ S(x).</p><p>• A set of allowed decisions A(s, x) for all s ∈ S(x).</p><p>• A transition function t(s, d, x) returning a new state s for any decision d ∈ A(s, x).</p><p>We will use a function ρ(s, d, x; θ) to compute the score of decision d in state s for input x. The vector θ contains the model parameters and we assume that ρ(s, d, x; θ) is differentiable with respect to θ. In this section, for brevity, we will drop the dependence of x in the functions given above, simply writing S, A(s), t(s, d), and ρ(s, d; θ).</p><p>Throughout this work we will use transition systems in which all complete structures for the same input x have the same number of decisions n(x) (or n for brevity). In dependency parsing for example, this is true for both the arc-standard and arc-eager transition systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Nivre, 2006</ref>), where for a sentence x of length m, the number of decisions for any complete parse is n(x) = 2 × m. 3 A complete structure is then a sequence of decision/state pairs (s 1 , d 1 ) . . . (s n , d n ) such that s 1 = s † , d i ∈ S(s i ) for i = 1 . . . n, and s i+1 = t(s i , d i ). We use the notation d 1:j to refer to a decision sequence d 1 . . . d j .</p><p>We assume that there is a one-to-one mapping between decision sequences d 1:j−1 and states s j : that is, we essentially assume that a state encodes the entire history of decisions. Thus, each state can be reached by a unique decision sequence from s † . <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We will use decision sequences d 1:j−1 and states interchangeably: in a slight abuse of notation, we define ρ(d 1:j−1 , d; θ) to be equal to ρ(s, d; θ) where s is the state reached by the decision sequence d 1:j−1 .</p><p>The scoring function ρ(s, d; θ) can be defined in a number of ways. In this work, following <ref type="bibr">Chen and Manning (2014)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Weiss et al. (2015)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">Zhou et al.

Note that the score is linear in the parameters θ <ref type="bibr">(d)</ref> . We next describe how softmax-style normalization can be performed at the local or global level.</p></div>

It is straightforward to derive gradients of the loss in Eq. <ref type="formula">(6)</ref> and to back-propagate gradients to all levels of a neural network defining the score ρ(s, d; θ). If the gold path remains in the beam throughout decoding, a gradient step is performed using B n , the beam at the end of decoding.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The Label Bias Problem</head><p>Intuitively, we would like the model to be able to revise an earlier decision made during search, when later evidence becomes available that rules out the earlier decision as incorrect. At first glance, it might appear that a locally normalized model used in conjunction with beam search or exact search is able to revise earlier decisions. However the label bias problem (see <ref type="bibr">Bottou (1991)</ref>, Collins (1999) pages 222-226, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lafferty et al. (2001)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Bottou and LeCun (2005)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Smith and Johnson (2007)</ref>) means that locally normalized models often have a very weak ability to revise earlier decisions.</p><p>This section gives a formal perspective on the label bias problem, through a proof that globally normalized models are strictly more expressive than locally normalized models. The theorem was originally proved <ref type="bibr">5</ref> by <ref type="bibr">Smith and Johnson (2007)</ref>.</p><p>The example underlying the proof gives a clear illustration of the label bias problem. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Global Models can be Strictly More Expressive than Local Models Consider a tagging problem where the task is to map an input sequence x 1:n to a decision sequence d 1:n .

Note that the theorem refers to conditional models of the form p(d1:n|x1:n) with global or local normalization.

The ambiguity at input symbol b is naturally resolved when the next symbol (c or e) is observed, but the locally normalized model is not able to revise its prediction.</p><p>It is easy to fix the locally normalized model for the example in Eq. (7) by allowing scores ρ(d 1:i−1 , d i , x 1:i+1 ) that take into account the input symbol x i+1 . More generally we can have a model of the form ρ(d 1:i−1 , d i , x 1:i+k ) where the integer k specifies the amount of lookahead in the model. Such lookahead is common in practice, but insufficient in general. For every amount of lookahead k, we can construct examples that cannot be modeled with a locally normalized model by duplicating the middle input b in (7) k + 1 times. Only a local model with scores ρ(d 1:i−1 , d i , x 1:n ) that considers the entire input can capture any distribution p(d 1:n |x 1:n ): in this case the decompo-</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">sition p L (d 1:n |x 1:n ) = n i=1 p L (d i |d 1:i−1 , x 1:n ) makes no independence assumptions.</formula><p>However, increasing the amount of context used as input comes at a cost, requiring more powerful learning algorithms, and potentially more training data. For a detailed analysis of the tradeoffs between structural features in CRFs and more powerful local classifiers without structural constraints, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Liang et al. (2008)</ref>; in these experiments local classifiers are unable to reach the performance of CRFs on problems such as parsing and named entity recognition where structural constraints are important. Note that there is nothing to preclude an approach that makes use of both global normalization and more powerful scoring functions ρ(d 1:i−1 , d i , x 1:n ), obtaining the best of both worlds. The experiments that follow make use of both.</p></div>

We conducted experiments on a number of different datasets: (1) the English Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of the Penn</head><p>Treebank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Marcus et al., 1993</ref>) with standard POS tagging splits; (2) the English "Treebank Union" multi-domain corpus containing data from the OntoNotes corpus version 5 <ref type="figure">(Hovy et al., 2006)</ref>, the English Web Treebank ( <ref type="bibr">Petrov and McDon- ald, 2012)</ref>, and the updated and corrected Question Treebank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Judge et al., 2006</ref>) with identical setup to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Weiss et al. (2015)</ref>; and (3) the CoNLL '09 multi-lingual shared task <ref type="figure">(Hajič et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Model Configuration. Inspired by the integrated POS tagging and parsing transition system of Bohnet and Nivre (2012), we employ a simple transition system that uses only a SHIFT action and predicts the POS tag of the current word on the buffer as it gets shifted to the stack. We extract the following features on a window ±3 tokens centered at the current focus token: word, cluster, character n-gram up to length 3. We also extract the tag predicted for the previous 4 tokens. The network in these experiments has a single hidden layer with 256 units on WSJ and Treebank Union and 64 on CoNLL'09.</p><p>Results. In <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> we compare our model to a linear CRF and to the compositional characterto-word LSTM model of . The CRF is a first-order linear model with exact inference and the same emission features as our model. It additionally also has transition features of the word, cluster and character n-gram up to length 3 on both endpoints of the transition. The results for  were solicited from the authors.</p><p>Our local model already compares favorably against these methods on average. Using beam search with a locally normalized model does not help, but with global normalization it leads to a 7% reduction in relative error, empirically demonstrating the effect of label bias. The set of character ngrams feature is very important, increasing average accuracy on the CoNLL'09 datasets by about 0.5% absolute. This shows that characterlevel modeling can also be done with a simple feed-forward network without recurrence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Dependency Parsing</head><p>In dependency parsing the goal is to produce a directed tree representing the syntactic structure of the input sentence.</p><p>Data &amp; Evaluation. We use the same corpora as in our POS tagging experiments, except that we use the standard parsing splits of the WSJ. To avoid over-fitting to the development set (Sec. 22), we use Sec. 24 for tuning the hyperparameters of our models. We convert the English constituency trees to Stanford style dependencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(De Marneffe et al., 2006</ref>) using version 3.3.0 of the converter. For English, we use predicted POS tags (the same POS tags are used for all models) and exclude punctuation from the evaluation, as is standard. For the CoNLL '09 datasets we follow standard practice and include all punctuation in the evaluation. We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alberti et al. (2015)</ref> and use our own predicted POS tags so that we can include a k-best tag feature (see below) but use the supplied predicted morphological features. We report unlabeled and labeled attachment scores (UAS/LAS).</p><p>Model Configuration. Our model configuration is basically the same as the one originally proposed by <ref type="bibr">Chen and Manning (2014)</ref> and then refined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Weiss et al. (2015)</ref>. In particular, we use the arc-standard transition system and extract the same set of features as prior work: words, part of speech tags, and dependency arcs and labels in the surrounding context of the state, as well as k-best tags as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alberti et al. (2015)</ref>. We use two hidden layers of 1,024 dimensions each.</p><p>Results. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Tables 2 and 3</ref> show our final parsing results and a comparison to the best systems from the literature. We obtain the best ever published results on almost all datasets, including the WSJ. Our main results use the same pre-trained word embeddings as <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Weiss et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alberti et al. (2015)</ref>, but no tri-training. When we artificially restrict ourselves to not use pre-trained word embeddings, we observe only a modest drop of ∼0.5% UAS; for example, training only on the WSJ yields 94.08% UAS and 92.15% LAS for our global model with a beam of size 32.</p><p>Even though we do not use tri-training, our model compares favorably to the 94.26% LAS and 92.41% UAS reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Weiss et al. (2015)</ref> with tri-training. As we show in Sec. 5, these gains can be attributed to the full backpropagation training that differentiates our approach from that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Weiss et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alberti et al. (2015)</ref>. Our results also significantly outperform the LSTM-based approaches of  and .    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Sentence Compression</head><p>Our final structured prediction task is extractive sentence compression.</p><p>Data &amp; Evaluation. We follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Filippova et al. (2015)</ref>, where a large news collection is used to heuristically generate compression instances. Our final corpus contains about 2.3M compression instances: we use 2M examples for training, 130k for development and 160k for the final test. We report per-token F1 score and per-sentence accuracy (A), i.e. percentage of instances that fully match the golden compressions. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Filippova et al. (2015)</ref> we also run a human evaluation on 200 sentences where we ask the raters to score compressions for readability (read) and informativeness (info) on a scale from 0 to 5.</p><p>Model Configuration. The transition system for sentence compression is similar to POS tagging: we scan sentences from left-to-right and label each token as keep or drop. We extract features from words, POS tags, and dependency labels from a window of tokens centered on the input, as well as features from the history of predictions. We use a single hidden layer of size 400.  Results. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> shows our sentence compression results. Our globally normalized model again significantly outperforms the local model. Beam search with a locally normalized model suffers from severe label bias issues that we discuss on a concrete example in Section 5. We also compare to the sentence compression system from Filippova et al. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2015)</ref>, a 3-layer stacked LSTM which uses dependency label information. The LSTM and our global model perform on par on both the automatic evaluation as well as the human ratings, but our model is roughly 100× faster. All compressions kept approximately 42% of the tokens on average and all the models are significantly better than the automatic extractions (p &lt; 0.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>We derived a proof for the label bias problem and the advantages of global models. We then emprirically verified this theoretical superiority by demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on three different tasks. In this section we situate and compare our model to previous work and provide two examples of the label bias problem in practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Related Neural CRF Work</head><p>Neural network models have been been combined with conditional random fields and globally normalized models before. <ref type="bibr">Bottou et al. (1997)</ref>   <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">(2015)</ref> finally combine CRFs and LSTMs. These neural CRF models are limited to sequence labeling tasks where exact inference is possible, while our model works well when exact inference is intractable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Related Transition-Based Parsing Work</head><p>For early work on neural-networks for transitionbased parsing, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Henderson (2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">2004</ref>). Our work is closest to the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Weiss et al. (2015)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Zhou et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Watanabe and Sumita (2015)</ref>; in these approaches global normalization is added to the local model of <ref type="bibr">Chen and Manning (2014)</ref>. Empirically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Weiss et al. (2015)</ref> achieves the best performance, even though their model keeps the parameters of the locally normalized neural network fixed and only trains a perceptron that uses the activations as features. Their model is therefore limited in its ability to revise the predictions of the locally normalized model. In Table 5 we show that full backpropagation training all the way to the word embeddings is very important and significantly contributes to the performance of our model. We also compared training under the CRF objective with a Perceptron-like hinge loss between the gold and best elements of the beam. When we limited the backpropagation depth to training only the top layer θ (d) , we found negligible differences in accuracy: 93.20% and 93.28% for the CRF objective and hinge loss respectively. However, when training with full back-  propagation the CRF accuracy is 0.2% higher and training converged more than 4× faster. <ref type="bibr">Zhou et al. (2015)</ref> perform full backpropagation training like us, but even with a much larger beam, their performance is significantly lower than ours. We also apply our model to two additional tasks, while they experiment only with dependency parsing. Finally, <ref type="bibr">Watanabe and Sumita (2015)</ref> introduce recurrent components and additional techniques like max-violation updates for a corresponding constituency parsing model. In contrast, our model does not require any recurrence or specialized training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Label Bias in Practice</head><p>We observed several instances of severe label bias in the sentence compression task. Although using beam search with the local model outperforms greedy inference on average, beam search leads the local model to occasionally produce empty compressions <ref type="table">(Table 6</ref>). It is important to note that these are not search errors: the empty compression has higher probability under p L than the prediction from greedy inference. However, the more expressive globally normalized model does not suffer from this limitation, and correctly gives the empty compression almost zero probability.</p><p>We also present some empirical evidence that the label bias problem is severe in parsing. We trained models where the scoring functions in parsing at position i in the sentence are limited to considering only tokens x 1:i ; hence unlike the full parsing model, there is no ability to look ahead in the sentence when making a decision. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> The result for a greedy model under this constraint Method Predicted compression pL pG</p><p>Local (B=1) In Pakistan, former leader Pervez Musharraf has appeared in court for the first time, on treason charges. 0.13 0.05 Local (B=8) In Pakistan, former leader Pervez Musharraf has appeared in court for the first time, on treason charges. 0.16 &lt;10 −4 Global (B=8) In Pakistan, former leader Pervez Musharraf has appeared in court for the first time, on treason charges. 0.06 0.07 <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Example sentence compressions where the label bias of the locally normalized model leads to a breakdown during beam search. The probability of each compression under the local (pL) and global (pG) models shows that only the global model can properly represent zero probability for the empty compression.</p><p>is 76.96% UAS; for a locally normalized model with beam search is 81.35%; and for a globally normalized model is 93.60%. Thus the globally normalized model gets very close to the performance of a model with full lookahead, while the locally normalized model with a beam gives dramatically lower performance. In our final experiments with full lookahead, the globally normalized model achieves 94.01% accuracy, compared to 93.07% accuracy for a local model with beam search. Thus adding lookahead allows the local model to close the gap in performance to the global model; however there is still a significant difference in accuracy, which may in large part be due to the label bias problem. A number of authors have considered modified training procedures for greedy models, or for locally normalized models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Daumé III et al. (2009)</ref> introduce Searn, an algorithm that allows a classifier making greedy decisions to become more robust to errors made in previous decisions. Goldberg and Nivre (2013) describe improvements to a greedy parsing approach that makes use of methods from imitation learning <ref type="bibr">(Ross et al., 2011</ref>) to augment the training set. Note that these methods are focused on greedy models: they are unlikely to solve the label bias problem when used in conjunction with beam search, given that the problem is one of expressivity of the underlying model. More recent work ( <ref type="bibr">Yazdani and Henderson, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vaswani and Sagae, 2016)</ref> has augmented locally normalized models with correctness probabilities or error states, effectively adding a step after every decision where the probability of correctness of the resulting structure is evaluated. This gives considerable gains over a locally normalized model, although performance is lower than our full globally normalized approach.</p></div>
