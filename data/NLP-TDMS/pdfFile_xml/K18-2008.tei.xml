			<abstract>
				<p>We propose a novel neural network model for joint part-of-speech (POS) tagging and dependency parsing. Our model extends the well-known BIST graph-based dependency parser (Kiperwasser and Goldberg, 2016) by incorporating a BiLSTM-based tagging component to produce automatically predicted POS tags for the parser. On the benchmark English Penn treebank, our model obtains strong UAS and LAS scores at 94.51% and 92.87%, respectively, producing 1.5+% absolute improvements to the BIST graph-based parser, and also obtaining a state-of-the-art POS tagging accuracy at 97.97%. Furthermore, experimental results on parsing 61 &quot;big&quot; Universal Dependencies treebanks from raw texts show that our model outperforms the base-line UDPipe (Straka and Straková, 2017) with 0.8% higher average POS tagging score and 3.6% higher average LAS score. In addition, with our model, we also obtain state-of-the-art downstream task scores for biomedical event extraction and opinion analysis applications. Our code is available together with all pre-trained models at: https://github. com/datquocnguyen/jPTDP.</p>

Some work has attempted to avoid using POS tags for dependency parsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">de Lhoneux et al., 2017)</ref>, however, to achieve the strongest parsing scores these methods still require automatically assigned POS tags. Alternatively, joint POS tagging and dependency parsing has also attracted a lot of attention in NLP community as it could help improve both tagging and parsing results over independent modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Li et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Hatori et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Lee et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bohnet and Nivre, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Zhang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Zhang and Weiss, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Yang et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based model for jointly learning POS tagging and dependency paring.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Our joint model</head><p>This section presents our model for joint POS tagging and graph-based dependency parsing. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig- ure 1</ref> illustrates the architecture of our joint model which can be viewed as a two-component mixture of a tagging component and a parsing component. Given word tokens in an input sentence, the tagging component uses a BiLSTM to learn "latent" feature vectors representing these word tokens. Then the tagging component feeds these feature vectors into a multilayer perceptron with one hidden layer (MLP) to predict POS tags. The parsing component then uses another BiLSTM to learn another set of latent feature representations, based on both the input word tokens and the predicted POS tags. These latent feature representations are fed into a MLP to decode dependency arcs and another MLP to label the predicted dependency arcs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Word vector representation</head><p>Given an input sentence s consisting of n word tokens w 1 , w 2 , ..., w n , we represent each i th word w i in s by a vector e i . We obtain e i by concatenating word embedding e </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">e i = e (W) w i • e (C) w i<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here, each word type w in the training data is represented by a real-valued word embedding e (W)</p><p>w . Given the word type w consisting of k characters w = c 1 c 2 ...c k where each j th character in w is represented by a character embedding c j , we use a sequence BiLSTM (BiLSTM seq ) to learn its character-level vector representation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Plank et al., 2016)</ref>. The input to BiLSTM seq is the sequence of k character embeddings c 1:k , and the output is a concatenation of outputs of a forward LSTM (LSTM f ) reading the input in its regular order and a reverse LSTM (LSTM r ) reading the input in reverse:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">e (C) w = BiLSTMseq(c 1:k ) = LSTMf(c 1:k ) • LSTMr(c k:1 )</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Tagging component</head><p>We feed the sequence of vectors e 1:n with an additional context position index i into another BiL-STM (BiLSTM pos ), resulting in latent feature vectors v </p><p>We use a MLP with softmax output (MLP pos ) on top of the BiLSTM pos to predict POS tag of each word in s. The number of nodes in the output layer of this MLP pos is the number of POS tags. Given v (pos) i , we compute an output vector as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">ϑ i = MLP pos (v (pos) i )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Based on output vectors ϑ i , we then compute the cross-entropy objective loss L POS ( ˆ t, t), in whichˆtwhichˆwhichˆt and t are the sequence of predicted POS tags and sequence of gold POS tags of words in the input sentence s, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Goldberg, 2016)</ref>. Our tagging component thus can be viewed as a simplified version of the POS tagging model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Plank et al. (2016)</ref>, without their additional auxiliary loss for rare words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Parsing component</head><p>Assume that p 1 , p 2 , ..., p n are the predicted POS tags produced by the tagging component for the input words. We represent each i th predicted POS tag by a vector embedding e (P) p i . We then create a sequence of vectors x 1:n in which each x i is produced by concatenating the POS tag embedding e (P) p i and the word vector representation e i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">x i = e (P) p i • e i = e (P) p i • e (W) w i • e (C) w i<label>(4)</label></formula><p>We feed the sequence of vectors x 1:n with an additional index i into a BiLSTM (BiLSTM dep ), resulting in latent feature vectors v i as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">v i = BiLSTM dep (x 1:n , i)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Based on latent feature vectors v i , we follow a common arc-factored parsing approach to decode dependency arcs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(McDonald et al., 2005</ref>). In particular, a dependency tree can be formalized as a directed graph. An arc-factored parsing approach learns the scores of the arcs in the graph <ref type="bibr">(Kübler et al., 2009</ref>). Here, we score an arc by using a MLP with a one-node output layer (MLP arc ) on top of the BiLSTM dep :</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">score arc (i, j) (6) = MLP arc v i • v j • (v i * v j ) • |v i − v j |</formula><p>where (v i * v j ) and |v i − v j | denote the elementwise product and the absolute element-wise difference, respectively; and v i and v j are correspondingly the latent feature vectors associating to the i th and j th words in s, computed by Equation 5. Given the arc scores, we use the Eisner (1996)'s decoding algorithm to find the highest scoring projective parse tree:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">score(s) = argmaxˆy∈Y argmaxˆ argmaxˆy∈Y(s) (h,m)∈ˆy∈ˆy score arc (h, m) (7)</formula><p>where Y(s) is the set of all possible dependency trees for the input sentence s while score arc (h, m) measures the score of the arc between the head h th word and the modifier m th word in s.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016)</ref>, we compute a margin-based hinge loss L ARC with loss-augmented inference to maximize the margin between the gold unlabeled parse tree and the highest scoring incorrect tree.</p><p>For predicting dependency relation type of a head-modifier arc, we use another MLP with softmax output (MLP rel ) on top of the BiLSTM dep . Here, the number of the nodes in the output layer of this MLP rel is the number of dependency relation types. Given an arc (h, m), we compute an output vector as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">v (h,m) (8) = MLP rel v h • v m • (v h * v m ) • |v h − v m |</formula><p>Based on output vectors v (h,m) , we also compute another cross-entropy objective loss L REL for relation type prediction, using only the gold labeled parse tree.</p><p>Our parsing component can be viewed as an extension of the BIST graph-based dependency model <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kiperwasser and Goldberg, 2016)</ref>, where we additionally incorporate the character-level vector representations of words.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Joint model training</head><p>The training objective loss of our joint model is the sum of the POS tagging loss L POS , the structure loss L ARC and the relation labeling loss L REL :</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">L = L POS + L ARC + L REL (9)</formula><p>The model parameters, including word embeddings, character embeddings, POS embeddings, three one-hidden-layer MLPs and three BiLSTMs, are learned to minimize the sum L of the losses. Most neural network-based joint models for POS tagging and dependency parsing are transition-based approaches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Zhang and Weiss, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Yang et al., 2018</ref>), while our model is a graph-based method. In addition, the joint model JMT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hashimoto et al., 2017</ref>) defines its dependency parsing task as a head selection task which produces a probability distribution over possible heads for each word ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Our model is the successor of the joint model jPTDP v1.0 ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Nguyen et al., 2017</ref>) which is also a graph-based method. However, unlike our model, jPTDP v1.0 uses a BiLSTM to learn "shared" latent feature vectors which are then used for both POS tagging and dependency parsing tasks, rather than using two separate layers. As mentioned in Section 4, our model generally outperforms jPTDP v1.0 with 2.5+% LAS improvements on universal dependencies (UD) treebanks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Implementation details</head><p>Our model is released as jPTDP v2.0, available at https://github.com/datquocnguyen/ jPTDP. Our jPTDP v2.0 is implemented using DYNET v2.0 ( <ref type="bibr">Neubig et al., 2017</ref>) with a fixed random seed. 1 Word embeddings are initialized either randomly or by pre-trained word vectors, while character and POS tag embeddings are randomly initialized. For learning character-level word embeddings, we use one-layer BiLSTM seq , and set the size of LSTM hidden states to be equal to the vector size of character embeddings.</p><p>We apply dropout ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Srivastava et al., 2014</ref>) with a 67% keep probability to the inputs of BiLSTMs and MLPs. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Iyyer et al. (2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016)</ref>, we also apply word dropout to learn an embedding for unknown words: we replace each word token w appearing #(w) times in the training set with a special "unk" symbol with probability p unk (w) = 0.25 0.25+#(w) . This procedure only involves the word embedding part in the input word vector representation.</p><p>We optimize the objective loss using Adam ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kingma and Ba, 2014</ref>) with an initial learning rate at 0.001 and no mini-batches. For training, we run for 30 epochs, and restart the Adam optimizer and anneal its initial learning rate at a proportion of 0.5 every 10 epochs. We evaluate the mixed accuracy of correctly assigning POS tag together with dependency arc and relation type on the development set after each training epoch. We choose the model with the highest mixed accuracy on the development set, which is then applied to the test set for the evaluation phase.</p><p>For all experiments presented in this paper, we use 100-dimensional word embeddings, 50-dimensional character embeddings and 100-dimensional POS tag embeddings. We also fix the number of hidden nodes in MLPs at 100. Due to limited computational resource, for experiments presented in Section 3, we perform a minimal grid search of hyper-parameters to select the number of BiLSTM pos and BiLSTM dep layers from {1, 2} and the size of LSTM hidden states in each layer from {128, 256}. For experiments presented in sections 4 and 5, we fix the number of BiLSTM layers at 2 and the size of hidden states at 128.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Experiments on English Penn treebank</head><p>Experimental setup: We evaluate our model using the English WSJ Penn treebank <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Marcus et al., 1993</ref>). We follow a standard data split to use sections 02-21 for training, Section 22 for development and Section 23 for test <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chen and Manning, 2014)</ref>, employing the Stanford conversion toolkit v3.3.0 to generate dependency trees with Stanford basic dependencies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">de Marneffe and Manning, 2008)</ref>. Word embeddings are initialized by 100-dimensional GloVe word vectors pre-trained on Wikipedia and Gigaword ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> As mentioned in Section 2.5, we perform a minimal grid search of hyper-parameters and find that the highest mixed accuracy on the development set is obtained when using 2 BiLSTM layers and 256-dimensional LSTM hidden states (in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, we present scores obtained on the development set when using 2 BiLSTM layers).</p><p>Main results: <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> compares our UAS and LAS scores on the test set with previous published results in terms of the dependency annotations. 3 <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Results on the development set. #states and "Without pun." denote the size of LSTM hidden states and the scores computed without punctuations, respectively. "POS" indicates the POS tagging accuracy. <ref type="bibr">[K&amp;G16]</ref> denotes results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016)</ref>.  The first 11 rows present scores of dependency parsers in which POS tags were predicted by using an external POS tagger such as the Stanford tagger ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Toutanova et al., 2003</ref>). The last 6 rows present scores for joint models. Clearly, our model produces very competitive parsing results. In particular, our model obtains a UAS score at 94.51% and a LAS score at 92.87% which are about 1.4% and 1.9% absolute higher than UAS and LAS scores of the BIST graph-based model <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kiperwasser and Goldberg, 2016)</ref>, respectively. Our model also does better than the previous transition-based joint models in , <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Zhang and Weiss (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Yang et al. (2018)</ref>, while obtaining similar UAS and LAS scores to the joint model JMT proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hashimoto et al. (2017)</ref>. We achieve 0.9% lower parsing scores than the state-of-the-art dependency parser of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dozat and Manning (2017)</ref>. While also a BiLSTM-and graph-based model, it uses a more sophisticated attention mechanism "biaffine" for better decoding dependency arcs and relation types. In future work, we will extend our model with the biaffine attention mechanism to investigate the benefit for our model. Other differences are that they use a higher dimensional representation than ours, but rely on predicted POS tags.</p></div>

The 82 treebanks are taken from UD v2. <ref type="bibr">2 (Nivre et al., 2018)</ref>, where 61/82 test sets are for "big" UD treebanks for which both training and development data sets are available and 5/82 test sets are extra "parallel" test sets in languages where another big treebank exists. In addition, 7/82 test sets are for "small" UD treebanks for which development data is not available. The remaining 9/82 sets are in low-resource languages without training data or with a few gold-annotation sample sentences. For the 7 small treebanks without development data available, we split training data into two parts with a ratio 9:1, and then use the larger part for training and the smaller part for development. For each big or small treebank, we train a joint model for universal POS tagging and dependency parsing, using a fixed random seed and a fixed set System All Big PUD Small Low (82) (61) (5) (7)  "UPOS" denotes the universal POS tagging score. "All", "Big", "PUD", "Small" and "Low" refer to the macro-average scores over all 81, 61 big treebank, 5 parallel, 7 small treebank and 9 lowresource treebank test sets, respectively. "goldseg." denotes the scores of our jPTDP v2.0 model regarding gold segmentation, detailed in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>.</p><p>of hyper-parameters as mentioned in Section 2.5. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We evaluate the mixed accuracy on the development set after each training epoch, and select the model with the highest mixed accuracy. For parsing from raw text to universal dependencies, we employ CoNLL-U test files preprocessed by the baseline UDPipe 1. <ref type="bibr">2 (Straka and Straková, 2017)</ref>. Here, we utilize the tokenization, word and sentence segmentation predicted by UDPipe 1.2. For 68 big and small treebank test files, we use the corresponding trained joint models. We use the joint models trained for cs pdt, en ewt, fi tdt, ja gsd and sv talbanken to process 5 parallel test files cs pud, en pud, fi pud, ja modern and sv pud, respectively. Since we do not focus on low-resource languages, we employ the baseline UDPipe 1.2 to process 9 low-resource treebank test files. The final test runs are carried out on the TIRA platform ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Potthast et al., 2014)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> presents our results in the CoNLL 2018 shared task on multilingual parsing from raw texts to universal dependencies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Zeman et al., 2018)</ref>. Over all 82 test sets, we outperform the baseline UDPipe 1.2 with 0.6% absolute higher average UPOS F1 score and 2.5+% higher average UAS and LAS F1 scores. In particular, for the "big" category consisting of 61 treebank test sets, we obtain 0.8% higher UPOS and 3.1% higher UAS and 3.6% higher LAS than UDPipe 1.2.</p><p>Our (UniMelb) official LAS-based rank is at 14 th place while the baseline UDPipe 1.2 is at 18 th place over total 26 participating systems. <ref type="bibr">6</ref> However, it is difficult to make a clear comparison between our jPTDP v2.0 and the parsing models used in other top systems. Several better participating systems simply reuse the state-of-theart biaffine dependency parser <ref type="bibr">(Dozat and Man- ning, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dozat et al., 2017)</ref>, constructing ensemble models or developing treebank concatenation strategies to obtain larger training data, which is likely to produce better scores than ours <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Zeman et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Recall that the shared task focuses on parsing from raw texts.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">UniMelb in the EPE 2018 campaign</head><p>Our UniMelb team also participated with jPTDP v2.0 in the 2018 Extrinsic Parser Evaluation (EPE) campaign <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fares et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> The EPE 2018 campaign runs in collaboration with the CoNLL 2018 shared task, which aims to evaluate dependency parsers by comparing their performance on three downstream tasks: biomedical event extraction , negation resolution ( ) and opinion analysis <ref type="bibr">(Jo- hansson, 2017</ref>). Here, participants only need to provide parsing outputs of English raw texts used in these downstream tasks; the campaign organizers then compute end-to-end downstream task 10 http://epe.nlpl.eu scores. General background can be also found in the first EPE edition . Unlike EPE 2017, the EPE 2018 campaign limited the training data to the English UD treebanks only. We unfortunately were unaware of this restriction during development of our model. Thus, we trained a jPTDP v2.0 model on dependency trees generated with the Stanford basic dependencies on a combination of the WSJ treebank, sections 02-21, and the training split of the GENIA treebank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Tateisi et al., 2005</ref>). We used the fixed set of hyper-parameters as used for the CoNLL 2018 shared task as mentioned in Section 2.5. <ref type="bibr">11</ref> We then submitted the parsing outputs by run-   <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fares et al., 2018</ref>.

The subscript in the SP17 column denotes the F1 scores obtained by Stanford-Paris w.r.t. the UD-v1-enhanced type of dependency representations, in which the average F1 score at 60.51 is the highest one at EPE 2017. ning our trained model on the pre-processed tokenized and sentence-segmented data provided by the campaign on the TIRA platform. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 5</ref> presents the results we obtained for three downstream tasks at EPE 2018 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fares et al., 2018</ref>). Since we employed external training data, our obtained scores are not officially ranked. In total 17 participating teams, we obtained the highest average F1 score over the three downstream tasks (i.e., we ranked first, unofficially). In particular, we achieved the highest F1 scores for both biomedical event extraction and opinion analysis. Our results may be high because the training data we used is larger than the English UD treebanks used by other teams. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 5</ref> also presents scores from the StanfordParis team ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Schuster et al., 2017</ref>)-the first-ranked team at EPE 2017 ( . Both EPE 2017 and 2018 campaigns use the same downstream task setups, therefore the downstream task scores are directly comparable. Note that Stanford-Paris employed the state-of-the-art biaffine dependency parser ) with larger training data. In particular, Stanford-Paris not only used the WSJ sections 02-21 and the training split of the GENIA treebank (as we did), but also included the Brown corpus. The downstream application of negation resolution requires parsing of fiction, which is one the genres included in the Brown corpus. Hence it is reasonable that the Stanford-Paris team produced better negation resolution scores than we did.</p><p>However, in terms of the Stanford basic dependencies, while we employ a less accurate parsing model with smaller training data, we obtain higher downstream task scores for event extraction and opinion analysis than the Stanford-Paris team. Consequently, better intrinsic parsing performance does not always imply better extrinsic downstream application performance. Similar observations on the biomedical event extraction and opinion analysis tasks can also be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Nguyen and Verspoor (2018)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gómez- Rodríguez et al. (2017)</ref>, respectively. Further investigations of this pattern requires much deeper understanding of the architecture of the downstream task systems, which is left for future work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have presented a novel neural network model for joint POS tagging and graphbased dependency parsing. On the benchmark English WSJ Penn treebank, our model obtains strong parsing scores UAS at 94.51% and LAS at 92.87%, and a state-of-the-art POS tagging accuracy at 97.97%.</p><p>We also participated with our joint model in the CoNLL 2018 shared task on multilingual parsing from raw texts to universal dependencies, and obtained very competitive results. Specifically, using the same CoNLL-U files pre-processed by UDPipe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Straka and Straková, 2017)</ref>, our model produced 0.8% higher POS tagging, 3.1% higher UAS and 3.6% higher LAS scores on average than UDPipe on 61 big UD treebank test sets. Furthermore, our model also helps obtain state-of-the-art downstream task scores for the biomedical event extraction and opinion analysis applications.</p><p>We believe our joint model can serve as a new strong baseline for both intrinsic POS tagging and dependency parsing tasks as well as for extrinsic downstream applications. Our code and pre-trained models are available at: https:// github.com/datquocnguyen/jPTDP.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Illustration of our new model for joint POS tagging and graph-based dependency parsing.</figDesc></figure>
