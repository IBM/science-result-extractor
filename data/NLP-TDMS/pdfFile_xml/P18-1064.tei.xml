				<p>An accurate abstractive summary of a document should contain all its salient information and should be logically entailed by the input document. We improve these important aspects of abstractive summa-rization via multi-task learning with the auxiliary tasks of question generation and entailment generation, where the former teaches the summarization model how to look for salient questioning-worthy details , and the latter teaches the model how to rewrite a summary which is a directed-logical subset of the input document. We also propose novel multi-task architectures with high-level (seman-tic) layer-specific sharing across multiple encoder and decoder layers of the three tasks, as well as soft-sharing mechanisms (and show performance ablations and analysis examples of each contribution). Overall, we achieve statistically significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on both the CNN/DailyMail and Gigaword datasets, as well as on the DUC-2002 transfer setup. We also present several quantitative and qualitative analysis studies of our model&apos;s learned saliency and entailment skills.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Abstractive summarization is the challenging NLG task of compressing and rewriting a document into a short, relevant, salient, and coherent summary. It has numerous applications such as summarizing storylines, event understanding, etc. As compared to extractive or compressive summarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Jing and McKeown, 2000</ref>; Knight and * Equal contribution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Marcu, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Clarke and Lapata, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Filippova et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Henß et al., 2015)</ref>, abstractive summaries are based on rewriting as opposed to selecting. Recent end-to-end, neural sequence-tosequence models and larger datasets have allowed substantial progress on the abstractive task, with ideas ranging from copy-pointer mechanism and redundancy coverage, to metric reward based reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Rush et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chopra et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Nallapati et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">See et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Despite these strong recent advancements, there is still a lot of scope for improving the summary quality generated by these models. A good rewritten summary is one that contains all the salient information from the document, is logically followed (entailed) by it, and avoids redundant information. The redundancy aspect was addressed by coverage models <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Suzuki and Nagata, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chen et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Nallapati et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">See et al., 2017</ref>), but we still need to teach these models about how to better detect salient information from the input document, as well as about better logicallydirected natural language inference skills.</p><p>In this work, we improve abstractive text summarization via soft, high-level (semantic) layerspecific multi-task learning with two relevant auxiliary tasks. The first is that of document-toquestion generation, which teaches the summarization model about what are the right questions to ask, which in turn is directly related to what the salient information in the input document is. The second auxiliary task is a premise-to-entailment generation task to teach it how to rewrite a summary which is a directed-logical subset of (i.e., logically follows from) the input document, and contains no contradictory or unrelated information. For the question generation task, we use the SQuAD dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rajpurkar et al., 2016)</ref>, where we learn to generate a question given a sentence containing the answer, similar to the recent work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Du et al. (2017)</ref>. Our entailment generation task is based on the recent SNLI classification dataset and task <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bowman et al., 2015</ref>), converted to a generation task ( .</p><p>Further, we also present novel multi-task learning architectures based on multi-layered encoder and decoder models, where we empirically show that it is substantially better to share the higherlevel semantic layers between the three aforementioned tasks, while keeping the lower-level (lexico-syntactic) layers unshared. We also explore different ways to optimize the shared parameters and show that 'soft' parameter sharing achieves higher performance than hard sharing.</p><p>Empirically, our soft, layer-specific sharing model with the question and entailment generation auxiliary tasks achieves statistically significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on both the CNN/DailyMail and Gigaword datasets. It also performs significantly better on the DUC-2002 transfer setup, demonstrating its strong generalizability as well as the importance of auxiliary knowledge in low-resource scenarios. We also report improvements on our auxiliary question and entailment generation tasks over their respective previous state-of-the-art. Moreover, we significantly decrease the training time of the multitask models by initializing the individual tasks from their pretrained baseline models. Finally, we present human evaluation studies as well as detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis studies of the improved saliency detection and logical inference skills learned by our multi-task model.</p></div>

This current paper has several major differences: (1) We present question generation as an additional effective auxiliary task to enhance the important complementary aspect of saliency detection; (2) Our new high-level layer-specific sharing approach is significantly better than alternative layer-sharing approaches (including the decoder-only sharing by ); (3) Our new soft sharing parameter approach gives stat. significant improvements over hard sharing; (4) We propose a useful idea of starting multi-task models from their pretrained baselines, which significantly speeds up our experiment cycle 1 ; (5) For evaluation, we show diverse improvements of our soft, layer-specific MTL model (over state-of-the-art pointer+coverage baselines) on the CNN/DailyMail, Gigaword, as well as DUC datasets; we also report human evaluation plus analysis examples of learned saliency and entailment skills; we also report improvements on the auxiliary question and entailment generation tasks over their respective previous state-of-the-art.</p><p>In our work, we use a question generation task to improve the saliency of abstractive summarization in a multi-task setting. Using the SQuAD dataset ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rajpurkar et al., 2016)</ref>, we learn to generate a question given the sentence containing the answer span in the comprehension (similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Du et al. (2017)</ref>). For the second auxiliary task of entailment generation, we use the generation version of the RTE classification task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dagan et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lai and Hockenmaier, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Jimenez et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bowman et al., 2015)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Models</head><p>First, we introduce our pointer+coverage baseline model and then our two auxiliary tasks: question generation and entailment generation (and finally the multi-task learning models in Sec. 4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Baseline Pointer+Coverage Model</head><p>We use a sequence-attention-sequence model with a 2-layer bidirectional LSTM-RNN encoder and a 2-layer uni-directional LSTM-RNN decoder, along with <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bahdanau et al. (2015)</ref> style attention. Let x = {x 1 , x 2 , ..., x m } be the source document and y = {y 1 , y 2 , ..., y n } be the target summary. The output summary generation vocabulary distribution conditioned over the input source document is P v (y|x; θ) = n t=1 p v (y t |y 1:t−1 , x; θ). Let the decoder hidden state be s t at time step t and let c t be the context vector which is defined as a weighted combination of encoder hidden states. We concatenate the decoder's (last) RNN layer hidden state s t and context vector c t and apply a linear transformation, and then project to the vocabulary space by another linear transformation. Finally, the conditional vocabulary distribution at each time step t of the decoder is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p v (y t |y 1:t−1 , x; θ) = sfm(V p (W f [s t ; c t ]+b f )+b p )</formula><p>(1) where, W f , V p , b f , b p are trainable parameters, and sfm(·) is the softmax function.</p><p>Pointer-Generator Networks Pointer mechanism (  helps in directly copying the words from the source sequence during target sequence generation, which is a good fit for a task like summarization. Our pointer mechanism approach is similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">See et al. (2017)</ref>, who use a soft switch based on the generation probability p g = σ(W g c t +U g s t +V g e w t−1 +b g ), where σ(·) is a sigmoid function, W g , U g , V g and b g are parameters learned during training. e w t−1 is the previous time step output word embedding. The final word distribution is P f (y) = p g ·P v (y)+(1−p g )·P c (y), where P v vocabulary distribution is as shown in Eq. 1, and copy distribution P c is based on the attention distribution over source document words.</p><p>Coverage Mechanism Following previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(See et al., 2017)</ref>, coverage helps alleviate the issue of word repetition while generating long summaries. We maintain a coverage vectorˆc vectorˆ vectorˆc t = t−1 t=0 α t that sums over all of the previous time steps attention distributions α t , and this is added as input to the attention mechanism. Coverage loss is L cov (θ) = t i min(α t,i , ˆ c t,i ). Finally, the total loss is a weighted combination of cross-entropy loss and coverage loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L(θ) = − log P f (y) + λL cov (θ) (2)</formula><p>where λ is a tunable hyperparameter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Two Auxiliary Tasks</head><p>Despite the strengths of the strong model described above with attention, pointer, and coverage, a good summary should also contain maximal salient information and be a directed logical entailment of the source document. We teach these skills to the abstractive summarization model via multi-task training with two related auxiliary tasks: question generation task and entailment generation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Question Generation</head><p>The task of question generation is to generate a question from a given input sentence, which in turn is related to the skill of being able to find the important salient information to ask questions about. First the model has to identify the important information present in the given sentence, then it has to frame (generate) a question based on this salient information, such that, given the sentence and the question, one has to be able to predict the correct answer (salient information in this case). A good summary should also be able to find and extract all the salient information in the given source document, and hence we incorporate such capabilities into our abstractive text summarization model by multi-task learning it with a question generation task, sharing some common parameters/representations (see more details in Sec. 4). For setting up the question generation task, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Du et al. (2017)</ref> and use the SQuAD dataset to extract sentencequestion pairs. Next, we use the same sequenceto-sequence model architecture as our summarization model. Note that even though our question generation task is generating one question at a time 2 , our multi-task framework (see Sec. 4) is set up in such a way that the sentence-level knowledge from this auxiliary task can help the documentlevel primary (summarization) task to generate multiple salient facts -by sharing high-level semantic layer representations. See Sec. 7 and <ref type="table">Ta- ble 10</ref> for a quantitative evaluation showing that the multi-task model can find multiple (and more) salient phrases in the source document. Also see Sec. 7 (and supp) for challenging qualitative examples where baseline and SotA models only recover a small subset of salient information but our multi-task model with question generation is able to detect more of the important information.</p><p>Entailment Generation The task of entailment generation is to generate a hypothesis which is entailed by (or logically follows from) the given premise as input. In summarization, the generation decoder also needs to generate a summary that is entailed by the source document, i.e., does not contain any contradictory or unrelated/extraneous information as compared to the input document. We again incorporate such inference capabilities into the summarization model via multi-task learning, sharing some common representations/parameters between our summarization and entailment generation model (more details in Sec. 4). For this task, we use the entailmentlabeled pairs from the SNLI dataset (Bowman et al., 2015) and set it up as a generation task (using the same strong model architecture as our abstractive summarization model). See Sec. 7 and <ref type="table">Table 9</ref> for a quantitative evaluation showing that the multi-task model is better entailed by the source document and has fewer extraneous facts. Also see Sec. 7 and supplementary for qualitative examples of how our multi-task model with the entailment auxiliary task is able to generate more logically-entailed summaries than the baseline and <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We also tried to generate all the questions at once from the full document, but we obtained low accuracy because of this task's challenging nature and overall less training data.  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Overview of our multi-task model with parallel training of three tasks: abstractive summary generation (SG), question generation (QG), and entailment generation (EG). We share the 'blue' color representations across all the three tasks, i.e., second layer of encoder, attention parameters, and first layer of decoder.</p><p>SotA models, which instead produce extraneous, unrelated words not present (in any paraphrased form) in the source document.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Multi-Task Learning</head><p>We employ multi-task learning for parallel training of our three tasks: abstractive summarization, question generation, and entailment generation. In this section, we describe our novel layerspecific, soft-sharing approaches and other multitask learning details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Layer-Specific Sharing Mechanism</head><p>Simply sharing all parameters across the related tasks is not optimal, because models for different tasks have different input and output distributions, esp. for low-level vs. high-level parameters. Therefore, related tasks should share some common representations (e.g., high-level information), as well as need their own individual task-specific representations (esp. low-level information). To this end, we allow different components of model parameters of related tasks to be shared vs. unshared, as described next. Encoder Layer Sharing: <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Belinkov et al. (2017)</ref> observed that lower layers (i.e., the layers closer to the input words) of RNN cells in a seq2seq machine translation model learn to represent word structure, while higher layers (farther from input) are more focused on high-level semantic meanings (similar to findings in the computer vision community for image features <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Zeiler and Fergus, 2014)</ref>). We believe that while textual summarization, question generation, and entailment generation have different training data distributions and low-level representations, they can still benefit from sharing their models' high-level components (e.g., those that capture the skills of saliency and inference). Thus, we keep the lower-level layer (i.e., first layer closer to input words) of the 2-layer encoder of all three tasks unshared, while we share the higher layer (second layer in our model as shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>) across the three tasks. Decoder Layer Sharing: Similarly for the decoder, lower layers (i.e., the layers closer to the output words) learn to represent word structure for generation, while higher layers (farther from output) are more focused on high-level semantic meaning. Hence, we again share the higher level components (first layer in the decoder far from output as show in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>), while keeping the lower layer (i.e., second layer) of decoders of all three tasks unshared. Attention Sharing: As described in Sec. 3.1, the attention mechanism defines an attention distribution over high-level layer encoder hidden states and since we share the second, high-level (semantic) layer of all the encoders, it is intuitive to share the attention parameters as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Soft vs. Hard Parameter Sharing</head><p>Hard-sharing: In the most common multi-task learning hard-sharing approach, the parameters to be shared are forced to be the same. As a result, gradient information from multiple tasks will directly pass through shared parameters, hence forcing a common space representation for all the related tasks. Soft-sharing: In our soft-sharing approach, we encourage shared parameters to be close in representation space by penalizing their l 2 distances. Unlike hard sharing, this approach gives more flexibility for the tasks by only loosely coupling the shared space representations. We minimize the following loss function for the primary task in soft-sharing approach:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">L(θ) = − log P f (y)+λL cov (θ)+γθ s −ψ s (3)</formula><p>where γ is a hyperparameter, θ represents the primary summarization task's full parameters, while θ s and ψ s represent the shared parameter subset between the primary and auxiliary tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Fast Multi-Task Training</head><p>During multi-task learning, we alternate the minibatch optimization of the three tasks, based on a tunable 'mixing ratio' α s : α q : α e ; i.e., optimizing the summarization task for α s mini-batches followed by optimizing the question generation task for α q mini-batches, followed by entailment generation task for α e mini-batches (and for 2-way versions of this, we only add one auxiliary task at a time). We continue this process until all the models converge. Also, importantly, instead of training from scratch, we start the primary task (summarization) from a 90%-converged model of its baseline to make the training process faster. We observe that starting from a fully-converged baseline makes the model stuck in a local minimum. In addition, we also start all auxiliary models from their 90%-converged baselines, as we found that starting the auxiliary models from scratch has a chance to pull the primary model's shared parameters towards randomly-initialized auxiliary model's shared parameters.</p></div>

For the pairwise model comparisons discussed in Sec. 6.2, we showed the annotators the input article, the ground truth summary, and the two model summaries (randomly shuffled to anonymize model identities) -we then asked them to choose the better among the two model summaries or choose 'Not-Distinguishable' if both summaries are equally good/bad. Instructions for relevance were defined based on the summary containing salient/important information from the given article, being correct (i.e., avoiding contradictory/unrelated information), and avoiding redundancy. Instructions for readability were based on the summary's fluency, grammaticality, and coherence.</p><p>Training Details All our soft/hard and layerspecific sharing decisions were made on the validation/development set.

Table 1 and <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> show that our full multi-task model achieves the best scores on CNN/DailyMail and Gigaword datasets, and the improvements are statistically significant on all metrics on both CNN/DailyMail (p &lt; 0.01 in ROUGE-1/ROUGE-L/METEOR and p &lt; 0.02 in ROUGE-2) and Gigaword (p &lt; 0.01 on all metrics). Finally, our 3-way multi-task model (with both entailment and question generation) outperforms the publicly-available pretrained result ( †) of the previous SotA ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">See et al., 2017</ref>) with stat. significance (p &lt; 0.01), as well the higher-reported results () on ROUGE-1/ROUGE-2 (p &lt; 0.01).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Human Evaluation</head><p>We also conducted a blind human evaluation on Amazon MTurk for relevance and readability, based on 100 samples, for both CNN/DailyMail and Gigaword (see instructions in Sec. 5).  <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>: ROUGE F1 scores on <ref type="bibr">DUC-2002.</ref> readability scores (and is higher in terms of total aggregate scores). One potential reason for this lower readability score is that our entailment generation auxiliary task encourages our summarization model to rewrite more and to be more abstractive than <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">See et al. (2017)</ref> -see abstractiveness results in <ref type="table">Table 11</ref>.</p><p>We also show human evaluation results on the Gigaword dataset in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref> (again based on pairwise comparisons for 100 samples), where we see that our MTL model is better than our state-of-theart baseline on both relevance and readability. <ref type="bibr">7</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Generalizability Results (DUC-2002)</head><p>Next, we also tested our model's generalizability/transfer skills, where we take the models trained on CNN/DailyMail and directly test them on DUC-2002. We take our baseline and 3-way multi-task models, plus the pointer-coverage model from <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">See et al. (2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We only retune the beam-size for each of these three models separately (based on DUC-2003 as the validation set). <ref type="bibr">9</ref> As shown in <ref type="table">Table 5</ref>, our multitask model achieves statistically significant improvements over the strong baseline (p &lt; 0.01 in ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L) and the pointercoverage model from See et al. (2017) (p &lt; 0.01 in all metrics). This demonstrates that our model is able to generalize well and that the auxiliary knowledge helps more in low-resource scenarios.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Auxiliary Task Results</head><p>In this section, we discuss the individual/separated performance of our auxiliary tasks.</p><p>Entailment Generation We use the same architecture as described in Sec. 3.1 with pointer mech-7 Note that we did not have output files of any previous work's model on Gigaword; however, our baseline is already a strong state-of-the-art model as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. <ref type="bibr">8</ref> We use the publicly-available pretrained model from See et al. (2017)'s github for these DUC transfer results, which produces the † results in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. All other comparisons and analysis in our paper are based on their higher results. <ref type="bibr">9</ref> We follow previous work which has shown that larger beam values are better and feasible for DUC corpora. However, our MTL model still achieves stat. significant improvements (p &lt; 0.01 in all metrics) over <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">See et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantitative Improvements in Entailment</head><p>We employ a state-of-the-art entailment classifier ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chen et al., 2017)</ref>, and calculate the average of the entailment probability of each of the output summary's sentences being entailed by the input source document. We do this for output summaries of our baseline and 2-way-EG multi-task model (with entailment generation).</p><p>As can be seen in <ref type="table">Table 9</ref>, our multi-task model improves upon the baseline in the aspect of being entailed by the source document (with statistical significance p &lt; 0.001). Further, we use the Named Entity Recognition (NER) module from CoreNLP ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Manning et al., 2014</ref>) to compute the number of times the output summary contains extraneous facts (i.e., named entities as detected by the NER system) that are not present in the source documents, based on the intuition that a well-entailed summary should not contain unrelated information not followed from the input premise. We found that our 2-way MTL model with entailment generation reduces this extraneous count by 17.2% w.r.t. the baseline. The qualitative examples below further discuss this issue of generating unrelated information.</p><p>Quantitative Improvements in Saliency Detection For our saliency evaluation, we used the Models Average Match Rate Baseline 27.75 % Multi- <ref type="table">Task (QG)</ref> 28.06 % <ref type="table">Table 10</ref>: Saliency classification results of our baseline vs. QG-multi-task model (p &lt; 0.01).  <ref type="table">Table 11</ref>: Abstractiveness: novel n-gram percent.</p></div>

The results are shown in <ref type="table">Ta- ble 10</ref>, where the 2-way-QG MTL model (with question generation) versus baseline improvement is stat. significant (p &lt; 0.01). Moreover, we found 93 more cases where our 2-way-QG MTL model detects 2 or more additional salient keywords than the pointer baseline model (as opposed to vice versa), showing that sentence-level question generation task is helping the document-level summarization task in finding more salient terms.</p><p>Qualitative Examples on Entailment and Saliency Improvements <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref> presents an example of output summaries generated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">See et al.
