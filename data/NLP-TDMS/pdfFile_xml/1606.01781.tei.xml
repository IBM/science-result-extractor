				<p>The dominant approach for many NLP tasks are recurrent neural networks, in particular LSTMs, and convolutional neural networks. However, these architectures are rather shallow in comparison to the deep convolutional networks which have pushed the state-of-the-art in computer vision. We present a new architecture (VD-CNN) for text processing which operates directly at the character level and uses only small convolutions and pooling operations. We are able to show that the performance of this model increases with the depth: using up to 29 convolutional layers, we report improvements over the state-of-the-art on several public text classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that very deep convolutional nets have been applied to text processing.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The goal of natural language processing (NLP) is to process text with computers in order to analyze it, to extract information and eventually to represent the same information differently. We may want to associate categories to parts of the text (e.g. POS tagging or sentiment analysis), structure text differently (e.g. parsing), or convert it to some other form which preserves all or part of the content (e.g. machine translation, summarization). The level of granularity of this processing can range from individual characters to subword units ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Sennrich et al., 2016)</ref> or words up to whole sentences or even paragraphs.</p><p>After a couple of pioneer works ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bengio et al. (2001)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Collobert and Weston (2008)</ref>, Collobert et al. (2011) among others), the use of neural networks for NLP applications is attracting huge interest in the research community and they are systematically applied to all NLP tasks. However, while the use of (deep) neural networks in NLP has shown very good results for many tasks, it seems that they have not yet reached the level to outperform the state-of-the-art by a large margin, as it was observed in computer vision and speech recognition.</p><p>Convolutional neural networks, in short ConvNets, are very successful in computer vision. In early approaches to computer vision, handcrafted features were used, for instance "scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Lowe, 2004)</ref>, followed by some classifier. The fundamental idea of ConvNets( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">LeCun et al., 1998</ref>) is to consider feature extraction and classification as one jointly trained task. This idea has been improved over the years, in particular by using many layers of convolutions and pooling to sequentially extract a hierarchical representation( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zeiler and Fergus, 2014</ref>) of the input. The best networks are using more than 150 layers as in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">He et al., 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">He et al., 2016b</ref>).</p><p>Many NLP approaches consider words as basic units. An important step was the introduction of continuous representations of words( <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bengio et al., 2003)</ref>. These word embeddings are now the state-of-the-art in NLP. However, it is less clear how we should best represent a sequence of words, e.g. a whole sentence, which has complicated syntactic and semantic relations. In general, in the same sentence, we may be faced with local and long-range dependencies. Currently, the mainstream approach is to consider a sentence as a sequence of tokens (characters or words) and to process them with a recurrent neural network (RNN). Tokens are usually processed in sequential order, from left to right, and the RNN is expected to "memorize" the whole sequence in its internal states. The most popular and successful RNN variant are certainly LSTMs <ref type="table">(Hochreiter and Schmid-Sample  Yelp P. +1  Been going to Dr. Goldberg for over 10 years.

However, we argue that LSTMs are generic learning machines for sequence processing which are lacking task-specific structure. We propose the following analogy. It is well known that a fully connected one hidden layer neural network can in principle learn any realvalued function, but much better results can be obtained with a deep problem-specific architecture which develops hierarchical representations. By these means, the search space is heavily constrained and efficient solutions can be learned with gradient descent. ConvNets are namely adapted for computer vision because of the compositional structure of an image. Texts have similar properties : characters combine to form n-grams, stems, words, phrase, sentences etc.</p><p>We believe that a challenge in NLP is to develop deep architectures which are able to learn hierarchical representations of whole sentences, jointly with the task. In this paper, we propose to use deep architectures of many convolutional layers to approach this goal, using up to 29 layers. The design of our architecture is inspired by recent progress in computer vision, in particular ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">He et al., 2016a)</ref>. This paper is structured as follows. There have been previous attempts to use ConvNets for text processing. We summarize the previous works in the next section and discuss the relations and differences. Our architecture is described in detail in section 3. We have evaluated our approach on several sentence classification tasks, initially proposed by . These tasks and our experimental results are detailed in section 4. The proposed deep convolutional network shows significantly better results than previous ConvNets approach. The paper concludes with a discussion of future research directions for very deep approach in NLP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>There is a large body of research on sentiment analysis, or more generally on sentence classification tasks. Initial approaches followed the classical two stage scheme of extraction of (handcrafted) features, followed by a classification stage. Typical features include bag-of-words or ngrams, and their TF-IDF. These techniques have been compared with ConvNets by . We use the same corpora for our experiments. More recently, words or characters, have been projected into a low-dimensional space, and these embeddings are combined to obtain a fixed size representation of the input sentence, which then serves as input for the classifier. The simplest combination is the element-wise mean. This usually performs badly since all notion of token order is disregarded.</p><p>Another class of approaches are recursive neural networks. The main idea is to use an external tool, namely a parser, which specifies the order in which the word embeddings are combined. At each node, the left and right context are combined using weights which are shared for all nodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Socher et al., 2011</ref>). The state of the top node is fed to the classifier. A recurrent neural network (RNN) could be considered as a special case of a recursive NN: the combination is performed sequentially, usually from left to right. The last state of the RNN is used as fixed-sized representation of the sentence, or eventually a combination of all the hidden states.</p><p>First works using convolutional neural networks for NLP appeared in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Collobert and Weston, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Collobert et al., 2011</ref>). They have been subsequently applied to sentence classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kim, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kalchbrenner et al., 2014;</ref>). We will discuss these techniques in more detail below. If not otherwise stated, all approaches operate on words which are projected into a high-dimensional space.</p><p>A rather shallow neural net was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kim, 2014)</ref>: one convolutional layer (using multiple widths and filters) followed by a max pooling layer over time. The final classifier uses one fully connected layer with drop-out. Results are reported on six data sets, in particular Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST). A similar system was proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kalchbrenner et al., 2014</ref>), but using five convolutional layers. An important difference is also the introduction of multiple temporal k-max pooling layers. This allows to detect the k most important features in a sentence, independent of their specific position, preserving their relative order. The value of k depends on the length of the sentence and the position of this layer in the network. (  were the first to perform sentiment analysis entirely at the character level. Their systems use up to six convolutional layers, followed by three fully connected classification layers. Convolutional kernels of size 3 and 7 are used, as well as simple max-pooling layers. Another interesting aspect of this paper is the introduction of several large-scale data sets for text classification. We use the same experimental setting (see section 4.1). The use of character level information was also proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dos Santos and Gatti, 2014</ref>): all the character embeddings of one word are combined by a max operation and they are then jointly used with the word embedding information in a shallow architecture. In parallel to our work, ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yang et al., 2016)</ref> proposed a based hierarchical attention network for document classification that perform an attention first on the sentences in the document, and on the words in the sentence. Their architecture performs very well on datasets whose samples contain multiple sentences.</p><p>In the computer vision community, the combination of recurrent and convolutional networks in one architecture has also been investigated, with the goal to "get the best of both worlds", e.g. ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pinheiro and Collobert, 2014</ref>). The same idea was recently applied to sentence classification ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Xiao and Cho, 2016)</ref>. A convolutional network with up to five layers is used to learn highlevel features which serve as input for an LSTM. The initial motivation of the authors was to obtain the same performance as (  with networks which have significantly fewer parameters. They report results very close to those of (  or even outperform ConvNets for some data sets.</p><p>In summary, we are not aware of any work that uses VGG-like or ResNet-like architecture to go deeper than than six convolutional layers ( ) for sentence classification. Deeper networks were not tried or they were reported to not improve performance. This is in sharp contrast to the current trend in computer vision where significant improvements have been reported using much deeper networks( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Krizhevsky et al., 2012</ref>), namely 19 layers (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015), or even up to 152 layers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">He et al., 2016a</ref>). In the remainder of this paper, we describe our very deep convolutional architecture and report results on the same corpora than ( . We were able to show that performance improves with increased depth, using up to 29 convolutional layers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">VDCNN Architecture</head><p>The overall architecture of our network is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Our model begins with a look-up table that generates a 2D tensor of size (f 0 , s) that contain the embeddings of the s characters. s is fixed to 1024, and f 0 can be seen as the "RGB" dimension of the input text.</p><p>We first apply one layer of 64 convolutions of size 3, followed by a stack of temporal "convolutional blocks". Inspired by the philosophy of VGG and ResNets we apply these two design rules: (i) for the same output temporal resolution, the layers have the same number of feature maps, (ii) when the temporal resolution is halved, the number of feature maps is doubled. This helps reduce the memory footprint of the network. The networks contains 3 pooling operations (halving the tempo-  resolution each time by 2), resulting in 3 levels of 128, 256 and 512 feature maps (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). The output of these convolutional blocks is a tensor of size 512 × s d , where s d = s 2 p with p = 3 the number of down-sampling operations. At this level of the convolutional network, the resulting tensor can be seen as a high-level representation of the input text. Since we deal with padded input text of fixed size, s d is constant. However, in the case of variable size input, the convolutional encoder provides a representation of the input text that depends on its initial length s. Representations of a text as a set of vectors of variable size can be valuable namely for neural machine translation, in particular when combined with an attention model. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, temporal convolutions with kernel size 3 and X feature maps are denoted "3, Temp Conv, X", fully connected layers which are linear projections (matrix of size I × O) are denoted "fc(I, O)" and "3-max pooling, stride 2" means temporal maxpooling with kernel size 3 and stride 2.</p><p>Most of the previous applications of ConvNets to NLP use an architecture which is rather shallow (up to 6 convolutional layers) and combines convolutions of different sizes, e.g. spanning 3, 5 and 7 tokens. This was motivated by the fact that convolutions extract n-gram features over tokens and that different n-gram lengths are needed to model short-and long-span relations. In this work, we propose to create instead an architecture which uses many layers of small convolutions (size 3). Stacking 4 layers of such convolutions results in a span of 9 tokens, but the network can learn by itself how to best combine these different "3-gram features" in a deep hierarchical manner. Our architecture can be in fact seen as a temporal adaptation of the VGG network <ref type="bibr">(Simonyan and Zisser- man, 2015</ref>). We have also investigated the same kind of "ResNet shortcut" connections as in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">He et al., 2016a</ref>), namely identity and 1 × 1 convolutions (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1)</ref>.</p><p>For the classification tasks in this work, the temporal resolution of the output of the convolution blocks is first down-sampled to a fixed dimension using k-max pooling. By these means, the network extracts the k most important features, independently of the position they appear in the sentence. The 512 × k resulting features are transformed into a single vector which is the input to a three layer fully connected classifier with ReLU hidden units and softmax outputs. The number of output neurons depends on the classification task, the number of hidden units is set to 2048, and k to 8 in all experiments. We do not use drop-out with the fully connected layers, but only temporal batch normalization after convolutional layers to regularize our network.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Convolutional Block</head><p>Each convolutional block (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2)</ref> is a sequence of two convolutional layers, each one followed by a temporal BatchNorm (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) layer and an ReLU activation. The kernel size of all the temporal convolutions is 3, with padding such that the temporal resolution is preserved (or halved in the case of the convolutional pooling with stride 2, see below). Steadily increasing the depth of the network by adding more convolutional layers is feasible thanks to the limited number of parameters of very small convolutional filters in all layers. Different depths of the overall architecture are obtained by varying the number of convolutional blocks in between the pooling layers (see table 2). Temporal batch normalization applies the same kind of regularization as batch normalization except that the activations in a mini-batch are jointly normalized over temporal (instead of spatial) locations. So, for a mini-batch of size m and feature maps of temporal size s, the sum and the standard deviations related to the BatchNorm algorithm are taken over |B| = m · s terms.</p><p>We explore three types of down-sampling between blocks K i and K i+1 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>) : (i) The first convolutional layer of K i+1 has stride 2 (ResNet-like).</p><p>(ii) K i is followed by a k-max pooling layer where k is such that the resolution is halved <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kalchbrenner et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>(iii) K i is followed by max-pooling with kernel size 3 and stride 2 (VGG-like).</p><p>All these types of pooling reduce the temporal resolution by a factor 2. At the final convolutional layer, the resolution is thus s d .  In this work, we have explored four depths for our networks: 9, 17, 29 and 49, which we define as being the number of convolutional layers. The depth of a network is obtained by summing the number of blocks with 64, 128, 256 and 512 filters, with each block containing two convolutional layers. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, the network has 2 blocks of each type, resulting in a depth of 2 × (2 + 2 + 2 + 2) = 16. Adding the very first convolutional layer, this sums to a depth of 17 convolutional layers. The depth can thus be increased or decreased by adding or removing convolutional blocks with a certain number of filters. The best configurations we observed for depths 9, 17, 29 and 49 are described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. We also give the number of parameters of all convolutional layers.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental evaluation 4.1 Tasks and data</head><p>In the computer vision community, the availability of large data sets for object detection and image classification has fueled the development of new architectures. In particular, this made it possible to compare many different architectures and to show the benefit of very deep convolutional networks. We present our results on eight freely available large-scale data sets introduced by ) which cover several classification tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic classification or news categorization (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>). The number of training examples varies from 120k up to 3.6M, and the number of classes is comprised between 2 and 14. This is considerably lower than in computer vision (e.g. 1 000 classes for ImageNet). <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Task  AG's news  120k  7.6k  4 English news categorization  Sogou news  450k  60k  5 Chinese news categorization  DBPedia  560k  70k  14 Ontology classification  Yelp Review Polarity  560k  38k  2 Sentiment analysis  Yelp Review Full  650k  50k  5 Sentiment analysis  Yahoo!

The main goal of our work is to show that it is possible and beneficial to train very deep convolutional networks as text encoders. Data augmentation may improve our results even further. We will investigate this in future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Common model settings</head><p>The following settings have been used in all our experiments. They were found to be best in initial experiments. Following ( ), all processing is done at the character level which is the atomic representation of a sentence, same as pixels for images. The dictionary consists of the following characters "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456 789-,;.!?:'"/| #$%ˆ&amp; * ˜'+=&lt;&gt;()[]{}" plus a special padding, space and unknown token which add up to a total of 69 tokens. The input text is padded to a fixed size of 1014, larger text are truncated. The character embedding is of size 16. Training is performed with SGD, using a mini-batch of size 128, an initial learning rate of 0.01 and momentum of 0.9. We follow the same training procedure as in ( . We initialize our convolutional layers following <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(He et al., 2015)</ref>. One epoch took from 24 minutes to 2h45 for depth 9, and from 50 minutes to 7h (on the largest datasets) for depth 29. It took between 10 to 15 epoches to converge. The implementation is done using Torch 7. All experiments are performed on a single NVidia K40 GPU. Unlike previous research on the use of ConvNets for text processing, we use temporal batch norm without dropout.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Experimental results</head><p>In this section, we evaluate several configurations of our model, namely three different depths and three different pooling types (see Section 3). Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with small temporal convolution filters with different types of pooling, which shows that a significant improvement on the state-of-the-art configurations can be achieved on text classification tasks by pushing the depth to 29 convolutional layers.</p><p>Our deep architecture works well on big data sets in particular, even for small depths. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table  5</ref> shows the test errors for depths 9, 17 and 29 and for each type of pooling : convolution with stride 2, k-max pooling and temporal max-pooling.

The most important decrease in classification error can be observed on the largest data set Amazon Full which has more than 3 Million training samples.</p><p>Corpus:  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Best published results from previous work.  best results use a Thesaurus data augmentation technique (marked with an * ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yang et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Depth</head><p>Depth improves performance. As we increase the network depth to 17 and 29, the test errors decrease on all data sets, for all types of pooling (with 2 exceptions for 48 comparisons). Going from depth 9 to 17 and 29 for Amazon Full reduces the error rate by 1% absolute. Since the test is composed of 650K samples, 6.5K more test samples have been classified correctly. These improvements, especially on large data sets, are significant and show that increasing the depth is useful for text processing. Overall, compared to previous state-of-the-art, our best architecture with depth 29 and max-pooling has a test error of 37.0 compared to 40.43%. This represents a gain of 3.43% absolute accuracy. The significant improvements which we obtain on all data sets compared to Zhang's convolutional models do not include any data augmentation technique.</p><p>Max-pooling performs better than other pooling types. In terms of pooling, we can also see that max-pooling performs best overall, very close to convolutions with stride 2, but both are significantly superior to k-max pooling. Both pooling mechanisms perform a max operation which is local and limited to three consecutive tokens, while k-max polling considers the whole sentence at once. According to our experiments, it seems to hurt performance to perform this type of max operation at intermediate layers (with the exception of the smallest data sets).</p><p>Our models outperform state-of-the-art ConvNets. We obtain state-of-the-art results for all data sets, except AG's news and Sogou news which are the smallest ones. However, with our very deep architecture, we get closer to the stateof-the-art which are ngrams TF-IDF for these data sets and significantly surpass convolutional models presented in ( . As observed in previous work, differences in accuracy between shallow (TF-IDF) and deep (convolutional) models are more significant on large data sets, but we still perform well on small data sets while getting closer to the non convolutional state-of-the-art results on small data sets. The very deep models even perform as well as ngrams and ngrams-TF-IDF respectively on the sentiment analysis task of Yelp Review Polarity and the ontology classification task of the DBPedia data set. Results of Yang et al. (only on Yahoo Answers and Amazon Full) outperform our model on the Yahoo Answers dataset, which is probably linked to the fact that their model is task-specific to datasets whose samples that contain multiple sentences like (question, answer). They use a hierarchical attention mechanism that apply very well to documents (with multiple sentences).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Going even deeper degrades accuracy. Shortcut connections help reduce the degradation.</head><p>As described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(He et al., 2016a</ref>), the gain in accuracy due to the the increase of the depth is limited when using standard ConvNets. When the depth increases too much, the accuracy of the model gets saturated and starts degrading rapidly. This degradation problem was attributed to the fact that very deep models are harder to optimize. The gradients which are backpropagated through the very deep networks vanish and SGD with momentum is not able to converge to a correct minimum of the loss function. To overcome this degradation of the model, the ResNet model introduced shortcut connections between convolutional blocks that allow the gradients to flow more easily in the network ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">He et al., 2016a)</ref>.</p><p>We evaluate the impact of shortcut connections by increasing the number of convolutions to 49 layers. We present an adaptation of the ResNet model to the case of temporal convolutions for text (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1)</ref>. <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> shows the evolution of the test errors on the Yelp Review Full data set with or without shortcut connections. When looking at the column "without shortcut", we observe the same degradation problem as in the original ResNet article: when going from 29 to 49 layers, the test error rate increases from 35.28 to 37.41 (while the training error goes up from 29.57 to 35.54). When using shortcut connections, we observe improved results when the network has 49 layers: both the training and test errors go down and the network is less prone to underfitting than it was without shortcut connections.</p><p>While shortcut connections give better results when the network is very deep (49 layers), we were not able to reach state-of-the-art results with them. We plan to further explore adaptations of residual networks to temporal convolutions as we think this a milestone for going deeper in NLP. Residual units ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">He et al., 2016a</ref>) better adapted to the text processing task may help for training even deeper models for text processing, and is left for future research.</p><p>Exploring these models on text classification tasks with more classes sounds promising. Note that one of the most important difference between the classification tasks discussed in this work and ImageNet is that the latter deals with 1000 classes and thus much more information is back-propagated to the network through the gradepth without shortcut with shortcut 9 <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">37.63  40.27  17  36.10  39.18  29  35.28  36.01  49</ref> 37.41 36.15 <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>: Test error on the Yelp Full data set for all depths, with or without residual connections.</p><p>dients. Exploring the impact of the depth of temporal convolutional models on categorization tasks with hundreds or thousands of classes would be an interesting challenge and is left for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented a new architecture for NLP which follows two design principles: 1) operate at the lowest atomic representation of text, i.e. characters, and 2) use a deep stack of local operations, i.e. convolutions and max-pooling of size 3, to learn a high-level hierarchical representation of a sentence. This architecture has been evaluated on eight freely available large-scale data sets and we were able to show that increasing the depth up to 29 convolutional layers steadily improves performance. Our models are much deeper than previously published convolutional neural networks and they outperform those approaches on all data sets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the "benefit of depths" was shown for convolutional neural networks in NLP. Eventhough text follows human-defined rules and images can be seen as raw signals of our environment, images and small texts have similar properties. Texts are also compositional for many languages. Characters combine to form n-grams, stems, words, phrase, sentences etc. These similar properties make the comparison between computer vision and natural language processing very profitable and we believe future research should invest into making text processing models deeper. Our work is a first attempt towards this goal.</p><p>In this paper, we focus on the use of very deep convolutional neural networks for sentence classification tasks. Applying similar ideas to other sequence processing tasks, in particular neural machine translation is left for future research. It needs to be investigated whether these also benefit from having deeper convolutional encoders.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: VDCNN architecture.</figDesc></figure>
