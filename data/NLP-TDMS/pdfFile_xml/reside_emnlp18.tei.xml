				<p>Distantly-supervised Relation Extraction (RE) methods train an extractor by automatically aligning relation instances in a Knowledge Base (KB) with unstructured text. In addition to relation instances, KBs often contain other relevant side information, such as aliases of relations (e.g., founded and co-founded are aliases for the relation founderOfCompany). RE models usually ignore such readily available side information. In this paper, we propose RESIDE, a distantly-supervised neural relation extraction method which utilizes additional side information from KBs for improved relation extraction. It uses entity type and relation alias information for imposing soft constraints while predicting relations. RESIDE employs Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) to encode syntactic information from text and improves performance even when limited side information is available. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate RESIDE&apos;s effectiveness. We have made RESIDE&apos;s source code available to encourage reproducible research.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The construction of large-scale Knowledge Bases (KBs) like Freebase ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bollacker et al., 2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Wikidata (Vrandeči´Vrandeči´c and Krötzsch, 2014</ref>) has proven to be useful in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks like question-answering, web search, etc. However, these KBs are not exhaustive. Relation Extraction (RE) attempts to fill this gap by extracting semantic relationships between entity pairs from plain text. This task can be modeled as a simple classification problem after the entity pairs are specified. Formally, given an entity pair (e 1 ,e 2 ) from the KB and an entity annotated sentence (or instance), we aim to predict the * Research internship at Indian Institute of Science. relation r, from a predefined relation set, that exists between e 1 and e 2 . If no relation exists, we simply label it NA.</p><p>Most supervised relation extraction methods require large labeled training data which is expensive to construct. Distant Supervision (DS) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mintz et al., 2009</ref>) helps with the construction of this dataset automatically, under the assumption that if two entities have a relationship in a KB, then all sentences mentioning those entities express the same relation. While this approach works well in generating large amounts of training instances, the DS assumption does not hold in all cases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Riedel et al. (2010)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hoffmann et al. (2011)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Surdeanu et al. (2012)</ref> propose multi-instance based learning to relax this assumption. However, they use NLP tools to extract features, which can be noisy.</p><p>Recently, neural models have demonstrated promising performance on RE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Zeng et al. (2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zeng et al. ( , 2015</ref> employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to learn representations of instances.

However, all the above models rely only on the noisy instances from distant supervision for RE.</p><p>Relevant side information can be effective for improving RE.

Similarly, relation phrase "was started by" extracted using Open Information Extraction (Open IE) methods can be useful, given that the aliases of relation founderOfCompany, e.g., founded, co-founded, etc., are available. KBs used for DS readily provide such information which has not been completely exploited by current models. In this paper, we propose RESIDE, a novel distant supervised relation extraction method which utilizes additional supervision from KB through its neural network based architecture. RESIDE makes principled use of entity type and relation alias information from KBs, to impose soft constraints while predicting the relation. It uses encoded syntactic information obtained from Graph Convolution Networks (GCN), along with embedded side information, to improve neural relation extraction.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">GCN on Labeled Directed Graph</head><p>For a directed graph, G = (V, E), where V and E represent the set of vertices and edges respectively, an edge from node u to node v with label l uv is represented as (u, v, l uv ). Since, information in directed edge does not necessarily propagate along its direction, following  we define an updated edge set E which includes inverse edges (v, u, l −1 uv ) and selfloops (u, u, ) along with the original edge set E, where is a special symbol to denote self-loops. For each node v in G, we have an initial representation x v ∈ R d , ∀v ∈ V. On employing GCN, we get an updated d-dimensional hidden representation h v ∈ R d , ∀v ∈ V, by considering only its immediate neighbors <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kipf and Welling, 2017)</ref>. This can be formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">h v = f   u∈N (v) (W luv x u + b luv )   .</formula><p>Here, W luv ∈ R d×d and b luv ∈ R d are label dependent model parameters which are trained based on the downstream task. N (v) refers to the set of neighbors of v based on E and f is any non-linear activation function. In order to capture multihop neighborhood, multiple GCN layers can be stacked. Hidden representation of node v in this case after k th GCN layer is given as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">h k+1 v = f   u∈N (v) W k luv h k u + b k luv   .</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Integrating Edge Importance</head><p>In automatically constructed graphs, some edges might be erroneous and hence need to be discarded. Edgewise gating in GCN by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bastings et al., 2017;</ref> allows us to alleviate this problem by subduing the noisy edges. This is achieved by assigning a relevance score to each edge in the graph. At k th layer, the importance of an edge (u, v, l uv ) is computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">g k uv = σ h k u · ˆ w k luv + ˆ b k luv ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Here, ˆ w k luv ∈ R m andˆbandˆandˆb k luv ∈ R are parameters which are trained and σ(·) is the sigmoid function.

RESIDE consists of three components for learning a representation of a given bag, which is fed to a softmax classifier. We briefly present the components of RESIDE below. Each component will be described in detail in the subsequent sections. The overall architecture of RE-SIDE is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>1. Syntactic Sentence Encoding: RESIDE uses a Bi-GRU over the concatenated positional and word embedding for encoding the local context of each token. For capturing long-range dependencies, GCN over dependency tree is employed and its encoding is appended to the representation of each token. Finally, attention over tokens is used to subdue irrelevant tokens and get an embedding for the entire sentence. More details in Section 5.1. 2. Side Information Acquisition: In this module, we use additional supervision from KBs and utilize Open IE methods for getting relevant side information. This information is later utilized by the model as described in Section 5.2. 3. Instance Set Aggregation: In this part, sentence representation from syntactic sentence encoder is concatenated with the matched relation embedding obtained from the previous step. Then, using attention over sentences, a representation for the entire bag is learned. This is then concatenated with entity type embedding before feeding into the softmax classifier for relation prediction. Please refer to Section 5.3 for more details.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Syntactic Sentence Encoding</head><p>For each sentence in the bag s i with m tokens {w 1 , w 2 , ...w m }, we first represent each token by k-dimensional GloVe embedding ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>). For incorporating relative position of tokens with respect to target entities, we use p-dimensional position embeddings, as used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Zeng et al., 2014</ref>). The combined token embeddings are stacked together to get the sentence representation H ∈ R m×(k+2p) . Then, using Bi-GRU ( ) over H, we get the new sentence representation H gru ∈ R m×dgru , where d gru is the hidden state dimension. Bi-GRUs have been found to be quite effective in encoding the context of tokens in several tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Graves et al., 2013)</ref>. Although Bi-GRU is capable of capturing local context, it fails to capture long-range dependencies which can be captured through dependency edges. Prior works ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mintz et al., 2009</ref></p><note type="other">; He et al., 2018) have exploited features from syntactic dependency trees for improving relation extraction. Motivated by their work, we employ Syntactic Graph Convolution Networks for encoding this information. For a given sentence, we generate its dependency tree using Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014). We then run GCN over the dependency graph and use Equation 2 for</note><p>updating the embeddings, taking H gru as the input. Since dependency graph has 55 different edge labels, incorporating all of them overparameterizes the model significantly. Therefore, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Nguyen and Grishman, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Vashishth et al., 2018a</ref>) we use only three edge labels based on the direction of the edge {forward (→), backward (←), selfloop ()}. We define the new edge label L uv for an edge (u, v, l uv ) as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">L uv =     </formula><p>→ if edge exists in dependency parse ← if edge is an inverse edge if edge is a self-loop</p><p>For each token w i , GCN embedding h gcn i k+1 ∈ R dgcn after k th layer is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">h gcn i k+1 = f u∈N (i) g k iu × W k L iu h gcn u k + b k L iu .</formula><p>Here, g k iu denotes edgewise gating as defined in Equation 1 and L iu refers to the edge label defined above. We use ReLU as activation function f , throughout our experiments. The syntactic graph encoding from GCN is appended to Bi-GRU output to get the final token representation,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">h concat i as [h gru i ; h gcn i k+1 ].</formula><p>Since, not all tokens are equally relevant for RE task, we calculate the degree of relevance of each token using attention as used in  Figure 2: Relation alias side information extraction for a given sentence. First, Syntactic Context Extractor identifies relevant relation phrases P between target entities. They are then matched in the embedding space with the extended set of relation aliases R from KB. Finally, the relation embedding corresponding to the closest alias is taken as relation alias information. Please refer Section 5.2.</p><p>(Jat et al., 2018). For token w i in the sentence, attention weight α i is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">α i = exp(u i ) m j=1 exp(u j )</formula><p>where,</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">u i = h concat i · r.</formula><p>where r is a random query vector and u i is the relevance score assigned to each token. Attention values {α i } are calculated by taking softmax over {u i }. The representation of a sentence is given as a weighted sum of its tokens, s = m j=1 α i h concat i .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Side Information Acquisition</head><p>Relevant side information has been found to improve performance on several tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ling and Weld, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Vashishth et al., 2018b</ref>). In distant supervision based relation extraction, since the entities are from a KB, knowledge about them can be utilized to improve relation extraction. Moreover, several unsupervised relation extraction methods (Open IE) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Angeli et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mausam et al., 2012</ref>) allow extracting relation phrases between target entities without any predefined ontology and thus can be used to obtain relevant side information. In RESIDE, we employ Open IE methods and additional supervision from KB for improving neural relation extraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relation Alias Side Information</head><p>RESIDE uses Stanford Open IE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Angeli et al., 2015)</ref> for extracting relation phrases between target entities, which we denote by P. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, for the sentence Matt Coffin, executive of lowermybills, a company.., Open IE methods extract "executive of" between Matt Coffin and lowermybills. Further, we extend P by including tokens at one hop distance in dependency path from target entities. Such features from dependency parse have been exploited in the past by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mintz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">He et al., 2018)</ref>. The degree of match between the extracted phrases in P and aliases of a relation can give important clues about the relevance of that relation for the sentence. Several KBs like Wikidata provide such relation aliases, which can be readily exploited. In RESIDE, we further expand the relation alias set using Paraphrase database (PPDB) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Pavlick et al., 2015</ref>). We note that even for cases when aliases for relations are not available, providing only the names of relations give competitive performance. We shall explore this point further in Section 7.3. For matching P with the PPDB expanded relation alias set R, we project both in a d-dimensional space using GloVe embeddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>). Projecting phrases using word embeddings helps to further expand these sets, as semantically similar words are closer in embedding space ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mikolov et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>). Then, for each phrase p ∈ P, we calculate its cosine distance from all relation aliases in R and take the relation corresponding to the closest relation alias as a matched relation for the sentence. We use a threshold on cosine distance to remove noisy aliases. In RESIDE, we define a k r -dimensional embedding for each relation which we call as matched relation embedding (h rel ). For a given sentence, h rel is concatenated with its representation s, obtained from syntactic sentence encoder (Section 5.1) as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. For sentences with |P| &gt; 1, we might get multiple matched relations. In such cases, we take the average of their embeddings. We hypothesize that this helps in improving the performance and find it to be true as shown in Section 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Entity Type Side Information</head><p>Type information of target entities has been shown to give promising results on relation extraction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ling and Weld, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Yaghoobzadeh et al., 2017)</ref>. Every relation puts some constraint on the type of entities which can be its subject and object. For example, the relation person/place of birth can only occur between a person and a location. Sentences in distance supervision are based on entities in KBs, where the type information is readily available.</p><p>In RESIDE, we use types defined by FIGER ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ling and Weld, 2012</ref>) for entities in Freebase. For each type, we define a k t -dimensional embedding which we call as entity type embedding (h type ). For cases when an entity has multiple types in different contexts, for instance, Paris may have types government and location, we take the average over the embeddings of each type. We concatenate the entity type embedding of target entities to the final bag representation before using it for relation classification. To avoid over-parameterization, instead of using all fine-grained 112 entity types, we use 38 coarse types which form the first hierarchy of FIGER types.</p></div>

Overall, we find that RESIDE achieves higher precision over the entire recall range on both the datasets. All the non-neural baselines could not perform well as the features used by them are mostly derived from NLP tools which can be erroneous.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Ablation Results</head><p>In this section, we analyze the effect of various components of RESIDE on its performance. For this, we evaluate various versions of our model with cumulatively removed components. The experimental results are presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. We observe that on removing different components from RESIDE, the performance of the model degrades drastically. The results validate that GCNs are effective at encoding syntactic information. Further, the improvement from side information shows that it is complementary to the features extracted from text, thus validating the central thesis of this paper, that inducing side information leads to improved relation extraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Effect of Relation Alias Side Information</head><p>In this section, we test the performance of the model in setting where relation alias information is not readily available. For this, we evaluate the performance of the model on four different settings:</p><p>• None: Relation aliases are not available. • One: The name of relation is used as its alias.</p><p>• One+PPDB: Relation name extended using Paraphrase Database (PPDB).</p><p>• All: Relation aliases from Knowledge Base <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The overall results are summarized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>. We find that the model performs best when aliases are provided by the KB itself. Overall, we find that RESIDE gives competitive performance even when very limited amount of relation alias information is available. We observe that performance improves further with the availability of more alias information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we propose RESIDE, a novel neural network based model which makes principled use of relevant side information, such as entity type and relation alias, from Knowledge Base, for improving distant supervised relation extraction. RE-SIDE employs Graph Convolution Networks for encoding syntactic information of sentences and is robust to limited side information. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate RESIDE's effectiveness over stateof-the-art baselines. We have made RESIDE's source code publicly available to promote reproducible research.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Matt</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
