				<p>Several deep learning models have been proposed for question answering. However , due to their single-pass nature, they have no way to recover from local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers. To address this problem, we introduce the Dynamic Coattention Network (DCN) for question answering. The DCN first fuses co-dependent representations of the question and the document in order to focus on relevant parts of both. Then a dynamic pointing decoder iterates over potential answer spans. This iterative procedure enables the model to recover from initial local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers. On the Stanford question answering dataset, a single DCN model improves the previous state of the art from 71.0% F1 to 75.9%, while a DCN ensemble obtains 80.4% F1.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Question answering (QA) is a crucial task in natural language processing that requires both natural language understanding and world knowledge. Previous QA datasets tend to be high in quality due to human annotation, but small in size <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Berant et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Richardson et al., 2013</ref>). Hence, they did not allow for training data-intensive, expressive models such as deep neural networks.</p><p>To address this problem, researchers have developed large-scale datasets through semi-automated techniques ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hermann et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hill et al., 2016</ref>). Compared to their smaller, hand-annotated counterparts, these QA datasets allow the training of more expressive models. However, it has been shown that they differ from more natural, human annotated datasets in the types of reasoning required to answer the questions ( .</p><p>Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rajpurkar et al. (2016)</ref> released the Stanford Question Answering dataset (SQuAD), which is orders of magnitude larger than all previous hand-annotated datasets and has a variety of qualities that culminate in a natural QA task. SQuAD has the desirable quality that answers are spans in a reference document. This constrains answers to the space of all possible spans. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rajpurkar et al. (2016)</ref> show that the dataset retains a diverse set of answers and requires different forms of logical reasoning, including multi-sentence reasoning.</p><p>We introduce the Dynamic Coattention Network (DCN), illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>, an end-to-end neural network for question answering. The model consists of a coattentive encoder that captures the interactions between the question and the document, as well as a dynamic pointing decoder that alternates between estimating the start and end of the answer span. Our single model obtains an F1 of 75.9% compared to the best published result of 71.0% ( ). In addition, our ensemble model obtains an F1 of 80.4% compared to the second best result of 78.1% on the official SQuAD leaderboard. 1 <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> illustrates an overview of the DCN. We first describe the encoders for the document and the question, followed by the coattention mechanism and the dynamic decoder which produces the answer span.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">COATTENTION ENCODER</head><p>We propose a coattention mechanism that attends to the question and document simultaneously, similar to ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Lu et al., 2016)</ref>, and finally fuses both attention contexts. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> provides an illustration of the coattention encoder.</p><p>We first compute the affinity matrix, which contains affinity scores corresponding to all pairs of document words and question words: L = D Q ∈ R (m+1)×(n+1) .

Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cui et al. (2016)</ref>, we also compute the summaries C Q A D of the previous attention contexts in light of each word of the document. These two operations can be done in parallel, as is shown in Eq. 3.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">DYNAMIC POINTING DECODER</head><p>Due to the nature of SQuAD, an intuitive method for producing the answer span is by predicting the start and end points of the span ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Wang &amp; Jiang, 2016b)</ref>. However, given a question-document pair, there may exist several intuitive answer spans within the document, each corresponding to a local maxima. We propose an iterative technique to select an answer span by alternating between predicting the start point and predicting the end point. This iterative procedure allows the model to recover from initial local maxima corresponding to incorrect answer spans. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref> provides an illustration of the Dynamic Decoder, which is similar to a state machine whose state is maintained by an LSTM-based sequential model. During each iteration, the decoder updates its state taking into account the coattention encoding corresponding to current estimates of the start and end positions, and produces, via a multilayer neural network, new estimates of the start and end positions.</p><p>Let h i , s i , and e i denote the hidden state of the LSTM, the estimate of the position, and the estimate of the end position during iteration i. The LSTM state update is then described by Eq. 5.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">h i = LSTM dec h i−1 , u si−1 ; u ei−1<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where u si−1 and u ei−1 are the representations corresponding to the previous estimate of the start and end positions in the coattention encoding U . u 48 u 49 u 50 u 51 u 52</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">u 49 u 51 u s i񮽙1 u e i񮽙1 L S T M L S T M u s i u e i s i : 49</formula><p>e i : 51</p><p>Figure 3: Dynamic Decoder.

We compute α t and β t with separate neural networks. These networks have the same architecture but do not share parameters.</p><p>Based on the strong empirical performance of Maxout Networks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Goodfellow et al., 2013)</ref> and Highway Networks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Srivastava et al., 2015)</ref>, especially with regards to deep architectures, we propose a Highway Maxout Network (HMN) to compute α t as described by Eq. 8. The intuition behind using such model is that the QA task consists of multiple question types and document topics. These variations may require different models to estimate the answer span. Maxout provides a simple and effective way to pool across multiple model variations.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">α t = HMN start u t , h i , u si−1 , u ei−1<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Here, u t is the coattention encoding corresponding to the tth word in the document.

The max operation computes the maximum value over the first dimension of a tensor. We note that there is highway connection between the output of the first maxout layer and the last maxout layer.</p><p>To train the network, we minimize the cumulative softmax cross entropy of the start and end points across all iterations. The iterative procedure halts when both the estimate of the start position and the estimate of the end position no longer change, or when a maximum number of iterations is reached.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">EXPERIMENTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS</head><p>We train and evaluate our model on the SQuAD dataset. To preprocess the corpus, we use the tokenizer from Stanford CoreNLP ( ). We use as GloVe word vectors pretrained on the 840B Common Crawl corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>). We limit the vocabulary to words that are present in the Common Crawl corpus and set embeddings for out-of-vocabulary words to zero. Empirically, we found that training the embeddings consistently led to overfitting and subpar performance, and hence only report results with fixed word embeddings.</p><p>We use a max sequence length of 600 during training and a hidden state size of 200 for all recurrent units, maxout layers, and linear layers. All LSTMs have randomly initialized parameters and an initial state of zero. Sentinel vectors are randomly initialized and optimized during training. For the dynamic decoder, we set the maximum number of iterations to 4 and use a maxout pool size of 16. We use dropout to regularize our network during training ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Srivastava et al., 2014)</ref>, and optimize the model using ADAM <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kingma &amp; Ba, 2014</ref>). All models are implemented and trained with Chainer (Tokui et al., 2015).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">RESULTS</head><p>Evaluation on the SQuAD dataset consists of two metrics. The exact match score (EM) calculates the exact string match between the predicted answer and a ground truth answer. The F1 score calculates the overlap between words in the predicted answer and a ground truth answer. Because a document-question pair may have several ground truth answers, the EM and F1 for a documentquestion pair is taken to be the maximum value across all ground truth answers. The overall metric is then computed by averaging over all document-question pairs. The offical SQuAD evaluation is hosted on CodaLab 2 . The training and development sets are publicly available while the test set is withheld.</p><p>The performance of the Dynamic Coattention Network on the SQuAD dataset, compared to other submitted models on the leaderboard 3 , is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 1</ref>. At the time of writing, our singlemodel DCN ranks first at 66.2% exact match and 75.9% F1 on the test data among single-model submissions. Our ensemble DCN ranks first overall at 71.6% exact match and 80.4% F1 on the test data.</p><p>The DCN has the capability to estimate the start and end points of the answer span multiple times, each time conditioned on its previous estimates. By doing so, the model is able to explore local maxima corresponding to multiple plausible answers, as is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Odd (blue) rows denote the start distributions and even (red) rows denote the end distributions. i indicates the iteration number of the dynamic decoder. Higher probability mass is indicated by darker regions. The offset corresponding to the word with the highest probability mass is shown on the right hand side. The predicted span is underlined in red, and a ground truth answer span is underlined in green.</p><p>For example, Question 1 in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> demonstrates an instance where the model initially guesses an incorrect start point and a correct end point. In subsequent iterations, the model adjusts the start point, ultimately arriving at the correct start point in iteration 3. Similarly, the model gradually shifts probability mass for the end point to the correct word.</p><p>Question 2 shows an example in which both the start and end estimates are initially incorrect. The model then settles on the correct answer in the next iteration. Average # Tokens in Answer <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>: Performance of the DCN for various lengths of documents, questions, and answers. The blue dot indicates the mean F1 at given length. The vertical bar represents the standard deviation of F1s at a given length.</p><p>While the dynamic nature of the decoder allows the model to escape initial local maxima corresponding to incorrect answers, Question 3 demonstrates a case where the model is unable to decide between multiple local maxima despite several iterations. Namely, the model alternates between the answers "charged particle beam" and "particle beam weapons" indefinitely. Empirically, we observe that the model, trained with a maximum iteration of 4, takes 2.7 iterations to converge to an answer on average.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>: Single model ablations on the development set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Ablation</head><p>The performance of our model and its ablations on the SQuAD development set is shown in Table 2. On the decoder side, we experiment with various pool sizes for the HMN maxout layers, using a 2-layer MLP instead of a HMN, and forcing the HMN decoder to a single iteration. Empirically, we achieve the best performance on the development set with an iterative HMN with pool size 16, and find that the model consistently benefits from a deeper, iterative decoder network. The performance improves as the number of maximum allowed iterations increases, with little improvement after 4 iterations. On the encoder side, replacing the coattention mechanism with an attention mechanism similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Wang &amp; Jiang (2016b)</ref> by setting C D to QA D in equation 3 results in a 1.9 point F1 drop. This suggests that, at an additional cost of a softmax computation and a dot product, the coattention mechanism provides a simple and effective means to better encode the document and question sequences. Further studies, such as performance without attention and performance on questions requiring different types of reasoning can be found in the appendix. Performance across length One point of interest is how the performance of the DCN varies with respect to the length of document. Intuitively, we expect the model performance to deteriorate with longer examples, as is the case with neural machine translation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Luong et al., 2015)</ref>. However, as in shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, there is no notable performance degradation for longer documents and questions contrary to our expectations. This suggests that the coattentive encoder is largely agnostic to long documents, and is able to focus on small sections of relevant text while ignoring the rest of the (potentially very long) document. We do note a performance degradation with longer answers. However, this is intuitive given the nature of the evaluation metric. Namely, it becomes increasingly challenging to compute the correct word span as the number of words increases.</p><p>Performance across question type Another natural way to analyze the performance of the model is to examine its performance across question types. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref>, we note that the mean F1 of DCN exceeds those of previous systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Wang &amp; Jiang, 2016b;</ref>) across all question types. The DCN, like other models, is adept at "when" questions and struggles with the more complex "why" questions.</p><p>Breakdown of F1 distribution Finally, we note that the DCN performance is highly bimodal. On the development set, the model perfectly predicts (100% F1) an answer for 62.2% of examples and predicts a completely wrong answer (0% F1) for 16.3% of examples. That is, the model picks out partial answers only 21.5% of the time. Upon qualitative inspections of the 0% F1 answers, some of which are shown in Appendix A.4, we observe that when the model is wrong, its mistakes tend to have the correct "answer type" (eg. person for a "who" question, method for a "how" question) and the answer boundaries encapsulate a well-defined phrase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>We proposed the Dynamic Coattention Network, an end-to-end neural network architecture for question answering. The DCN consists of a coattention encoder which learns co-dependent representations of the question and of the document, and a dynamic decoder which iteratively estimates the answer span. We showed that the iterative nature of the model allows it to recover from initial local maxima corresponding to incorrect predictions. On the SQuAD dataset, the DCN achieves the state of the art results at 75.9% F1 with a single model and 80.4% F1 with an ensemble. The DCN significantly outperforms all other models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1 PERFORMANCE WITHOUT ATTENTION</head><p>In our experiments, we also investigate a model without any attention mechanism. In this model, the encoder is a simple LSTM network that first ingests the question and then ingests the document. The hidden states corresponding to words in the document is then passed to the decoder. This model achieves 33.3% exact match and 41.9% F1, significantly worse than models with attention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2 SAMPLES REQUIRING DIFFERENT TYPES OF REASONING</head><p>We generate predictions for examples requiring different types of reasoning, given by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rajpurkar et al. (2016)</ref>. Because this set of examples is very limited, they do not conclusively demonstrate the effectiveness of the model on different types of reasoning tasks. Nevertheless, these examples show that the DCN is a promising architecture for challenging question answering tasks including those that involve reasoning over multiple sentences.</p></div>

A problem X is hard for a class of problems C if every problem in C can be reduced to X. Thus no problem in C is harder than X, since an algorithm for X allows us to solve any problem in C. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used.

The Mongol rulers patronized the Yuan printing industry. Chinese printing technology was trans-
ferred to the Mongols through Kingdom of Qocho and Tibetan intermediaries. Some Yuan docu-
ments such as Wang Zhen's Nong Shu were printed with earthenware movable type, a technology 
invented in the 12th century. However, most published works were still produced through tradi-
tional block printing techniques. The publication of a Taoist text inscribed with the name of Tregene 
Khatun, gedei's wife, is one of the first printed works sponsored by the Mongols. In 1273, the 
Mongols created the Imperial Library Directorate, a government-sponsored printing office. The 
Yuan government established centers for printing throughout China. Local schools and government 
agencies were funded to support the publishing of books.

On 24 March 1879, Tesla was returned to Gospi under police guard for not having a residence 
permit. On 17 April 1879, Milutin Tesla died at the age of 60 after contracting an unspecified illness 
(although some sources say that he died of a stroke). During that year, Tesla taught a large class of 
students in his old school, Higher Real Gymnasium, in Gospi.
