				<p>This paper proposes a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network (RNN) language model that combines probability distributions computed not only from a final RNN layer but also from middle layers. Our proposed method raises the expressive power of a language model based on the matrix factorization interpretation of language modeling introduced by Yang et al. (2018). The proposed method improves the current state-of-the-art language model and achieves the best score on the Penn Treebank and WikiText-2, which are the standard benchmark datasets. Moreover, we indicate our proposed method contributes to two application tasks: machine translation and headline generation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Neural network language models have played a central role in recent natural language processing (NLP) advances. For example, neural encoderdecoder models, which were successfully applied to various natural language generation tasks including machine translation ), summarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Rush et al., 2015)</ref>, and dialogue ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wen et al., 2015</ref>), can be interpreted as conditional neural language models. Neural language models also positively influence syntactic parsing ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dyer et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Choe and Charniak, 2016)</ref>. Moreover, such word embedding methods as Skipgram ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) and vLBL <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Mnih and Kavukcuoglu, 2013</ref>) originated from neural language models designed to handle much larger vocabulary and data sizes. Neural language models can also be used as contextualized word representations ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Peters et al., 2018</ref>). Thus, language modeling is a good benchmark task for investigating the general frameworks of neural methods in NLP field.</p><p>In language modeling, we compute joint probability using the product of conditional probabilities. Let w 1:T be a word sequence with length T : w 1 , ..., w T . We obtain the joint probability of word sequence w 1:T as follows: p(w 1:T ) = p(w 1 )</p><p>T −1 t=1 p(w t+1 |w 1:t ).</p><p>(1) p(w 1 ) is generally assumed to be 1 in this literature, that is, p(w 1 ) = 1, and thus we can ignore its calculation. See the implementation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zaremba et al. (2014)</ref> 1 , for an example. RNN language models obtain conditional probability p(w t+1 |w 1:t ) from the probability distribution of each word. To compute the probability distribution, RNN language models encode sequence w 1:t into a fixed-length vector and apply a transformation matrix and the softmax function. Previous researches demonstrated that RNN language models achieve high performance by using several regularizations and selecting appropriate hyperparameters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Melis et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Merity et al., 2018</ref>). However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al. (2018)</ref> proved that existing RNN language models have low expressive power due to the Softmax bottleneck, which means the output matrix of RNN language models is low rank when we interpret the training of RNN language models as a matrix factorization problem. To solve the Softmax bottleneck, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al. (2018)</ref> proposed Mixture of Softmaxes (MoS), which increases the rank of the matrix by combining multiple probability distributions computed from the encoded fixed-length vector.</p><p>In this study, we propose Direct Output Connection (DOC) as a generalization of MoS. For stacked RNNs, DOC computes the probability distributions from the middle layers including input embeddings. In addition to raising the rank, the proposed method helps weaken the vanishing gradient problem in backpropagation because DOC provides a shortcut connection to the output.</p><p>We conduct experiments on standard benchmark datasets for language modeling: the Penn Treebank and WikiText-2. Our experiments demonstrate that DOC outperforms MoS and achieves state-of-theart perplexities on each dataset. Moreover, we investigate the effect of DOC on two applications: machine translation and headline generation. We indicate that DOC can improve the performance of an encoder-decoder with an attention mechanism, which is a strong baseline for such applications. In addition, we conduct an experiment on the Penn Treebank constituency parsing task to investigate the effectiveness of DOC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RNN Language Model</head><p>In this section, we briefly overview RNN language models. Let V be the vocabulary size and let P t ∈ R V be the probability distribution of the vocabulary at timestep t. Moreover, let D h n be the dimension of the hidden state of the n-th RNN, and let D e be the dimensions of the embedding vectors. Then the RNN language models predict probability distribution P t+1 by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P t+1 = softmax(W h N t ),<label>(2)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">h n t = f (h n−1 t , h n t−1 ),<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">h 0 t = Ex t ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where W ∈ R V ×D h N is a weight matrix 2 , E ∈ R De×V is a word embedding matrix, x t ∈ {0, 1} V is a one-hot vector of input word w t at timestep t, and h n t ∈ R D h n is the hidden state of the n-th RNN at timestep t. We define h n t at timestep t = 0 as a zero vector: h n 0 = 0. Let f (·) represent an abstract function of an RNN, which might be the Elman network <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Elman, 1990)</ref>, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al. (2018)</ref> indicated that the training of language models can be interpreted as a matrix factorization problem. In this section, we briefly introduce their description. Let word sequence w 1:t be context c t . Then we can regard a natural language as a finite set of the pairs of a context and its conditional probability distribution:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Language Modeling as Matrix Factorization</head><formula xml:id="formula_3">L = {(c 1 , P * (X|c 1 )), ..., (c U , P * (X|c U ))},</formula><p>where U is the number of possible contexts and X ∈ {0, 1} V is a variable representing a onehot vector of a word. Here, we consider matrix A ∈ R U ×V that represents the true log probability distributions and matrix H ∈ R U ×D h N that contains the hidden states of the final RNN layer for each context c t :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">A =     logP * (X|c 1 ) logP * (X|c 2 ) ... logP * (X|c U )     ; H =     h N c 1 h N c 2 ... h N c U     . (5)</formula><p>Then we obtain set of matrices F (A) = {A + ΛS}, where S ∈ R U ×V is an all-ones matrix, and Λ ∈ R U ×U is a diagonal matrix. F (A) contains matrices that shifted each row of A by an arbitrary real number. In other words, if we take a matrix from F (A) and apply the softmax function to each of its rows, we obtain a matrix that consists of true probability distributions. Therefore, for some A ∈ F (A), training RNN language models is to find the parameters satisfying the following equation:  In summary, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al. (2018)</ref> indicated that D h N is much smaller than rank(A) because its scale is usually 10 2 and vocabulary size V is at least 10 4 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">HW = A .<label>(6</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Proposed Method: Direct Output Connection</head><p>To construct a high-rank matrix, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al. (2018)</ref> proposed Mixture of Softmaxes (MoS). MoS computes multiple probability distributions from the hidden state of final RNN layer h N and regards the weighted average of the probability distributions as the final distribution. In this study, we propose Direct Output Connection (DOC), which is a generalization method of MoS. DOC computes probability distributions from the middle layers in addition to the final layer. In other words, DOC directly connects the middle layers to the output. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows an overview of DOC, that uses the middle layers (including word embeddings) to compute the probability distributions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> computes three probability distributions from all the layers, but we can vary the number of probability distributions for each layer and select some layers to avoid. In our experiments, we search for the appropriate number of probability distributions for each layer.</p><p>Formally, instead of Equation 2, DOC computes the output probability distribution at timestep t + 1 by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P t+1 = J j=1 π j,ct softmax( ˜ W k j,ct ),<label>(7)</label></formula><p>s.t.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">J j=1 π j,ct = 1,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where π j,ct is a weight for each probability distribution, k j,ct ∈ R d is a vector computed from each hidden state h n , and˜Wand˜ and˜W ∈ R V ×d is a weight matrix. Thus, P t+1 is the weighted average of J probability distributions. We define the U × U diagonal matrix whose elements are weight π j,c for each context c as Φ. Then we obtain matrix˜Amatrix˜ matrix˜A ∈ R U ×V :</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">˜ A = log J j=1 Φ softmax(K j ˜ W ),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where K j ∈ R U ×d is a matrix whose rows are vector k j,c . ˜ A can be an arbitrary high rank because the righthand side of Equation 9 computes not only the matrix multiplication but also a nonlinear function. Therefore, an RNN language model with DOC can output a distribution matrix whose rank is identical to one of the true distributions. In other words, ˜ A is a better approximation of A than the output of a standard RNN language model.</p><p>Next we describe how to acquire weight π j,ct and vector k j,ct . Let π ct ∈ R J be a vector whose elements are weight π j,ct . Then we compute π ct from the hidden state of the final RNN layer:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">π ct = softmax(W π h N t ),<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where W π ∈ R J×D h N is a weight matrix. We next compute k j,ct from the hidden state of the n-th RNN layer:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">k j,ct = W j h n t ,<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where W j ∈ R d×D h n is a weight matrix. In addition, let i n be the number of k j,ct from h n t . Then we define the sum of i n for all n as J; that is, N n=0 i n = J. In short, DOC computes J probability distributions from all the layers, including the input embedding (h 0 ). For i N = J, DOC becomes identical to MoS. In addition to increasing the rank, we expect that DOC weakens the vanishing gradient problem during backpropagation because a middle layer is directly connected to the output, such as with the auxiliary classifiers described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Szegedy et al. (2015)</ref>.</p><p>For a network that computes the weights for several vectors, such as Equation 10, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Shazeer et al. (2017)</ref> indicated that it often converges to a state where it always produces large weights for few vectors. In fact, we observed that DOC tends to assign large weights to shallow layers. To prevent this phenomenon, we compute the coefficient of variation of Equation 10 in each mini-batch as a regularization term following <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Shazeer et al. (2017)</ref>. In other words, we try to adjust the sum of the weights for each probability distribution with identical values in each mini-batch. Formally, we compute the following equation for a mini-batch consisting of w b , w b+1 , ..., w ˜ b :</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">B = ˜ b t=b π ct (12) β = std(B) avg(B) 2 ,<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where functions std(·) and avg(·) are functions that respectively return an input's standard deviation and its average. In the training step, we add λ β multiplied by weight coefficient β to the loss function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments on Language Modeling</head><p>We investigate the effect of DOC on the language modeling task. In detail, we conduct word-level prediction experiments and show that DOC improves the performance of MoS, which only uses the final layer to compute the probability distributions. Moreover, we evaluate various combinations of layers to explore which combination achieves the best score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Datasets</head><p>We used the Penn Treebank (PTB) ( </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Hyperparameters</head><p>Our implementation is based on the averaged stochastic gradient descent Weight-Dropped LSTM (AWD-LSTM) <ref type="bibr">5</ref> proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Merity et al. (2018</ref>   dropout rate for vector k j,ct and the non-monotone interval. Since we found that the dropout rate for vector k j,ct greatly influences β in Equation 13, we varied it from 0.3 to 0.6 with 0.1 intervals. We selected 0.6 because this value achieved the best score on the PTB validation dataset. For the nonmonotone interval, we adopted the same value as <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zolna et al. (2018)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> summarizes the hyperparameters of our experiments.    represents the number of probability distributions from hidden state h n t . To find the best combination, we varied the number of probability distributions from each layer by fixing their total to 20: J = 20. Moreover, the top row of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> shows the perplexity of AWD-LSTM with MoS reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al. (2018)</ref> for comparison. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> indicates that language models using middle layers outperformed one using only the final layer. In addition, <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table  3</ref> shows that increasing the distributions from the final layer (i 3 = 20) degraded the score from the language model with i 3 = 15 (the top row of Table 3). Thus, to obtain a superior language model, we should not increase the number of distributions from the final layer; we should instead use the middle layers, as with our proposed DOC. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> shows that the i 3 = 15, i 2 = 5 setting achieved the best performance and the other settings with shallow layers have a little effect. This result implies that we need some layers to output accurate distributions. In fact, most previous studies adopted two LSTM layers for language modeling. This suggests that we need at least two layers to obtain high-quality distributions.</p></div>

For (fin), we repeated fine-tuning until convergence. the effect of λ β in {0, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001}. Although <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> shows that λ β = 0.001 achieved the best perplexity, the effect is not consistent. <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Ta- ble 4</ref> shows the coefficient of variation of Equation 10, i.e., √ β in the PTB dataset. This table demonstrates that the coefficient of variation decreases with growth in λ β . In other words, the model trained with a large λ β assigns balanced weights to each probability distribution. These results indicate that it is not always necessary to equally use each probability distribution, but we can acquire a better model in some λ β . Hereafter, we refer to the setting that achieved the best score (i 3 = 15, i 2 = 5, λ β = 0.001) as AWD-LSTM-DOC. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref> shows the ranks of matrices containing log probability distributions from each method. In other words, <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 5</ref> describes˜Adescribes˜ describes˜A in Equation 9 for each method. As shown by this table, the output of AWD-LSTM is restricted to D 3 7 . In contrast, AWD-LSTM-MoS ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al., 2018)</ref> and AWD-LSTM-DOC outputted matrices whose ranks equal the vocabulary size. This fact indicates that DOC (including MoS) can output the same matrix as the true distributions in view of a rank. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> illustrates the learning curves of each method on PTB. This figure contains the validation scores of AWD-LSTM, AWD-LSTM-MoS, and AWD-LSTM-DOC at each training epoch. We trained AWD-LSTM and AWD-LSTM-MoS by setting the non-monotone interval to 60, as with AWD-LSTM-DOC. In other words, we used hyperparameters identical to the original ones to train AWD-LSTM and AWD-LSTM-MoS, except for the non-monotone interval. We note that the optimization method converts the ordinary stochastic   <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gal and Ghahramani, 2016)</ref> 20M 81.9 ± 0.2 79.7 ± 0.1 Variational LSTM (large) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gal and Ghahramani, 2016</ref>   gradient descent (SGD) into the averaged SGD at the point where convergence almost occurs. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig- ure 2</ref>, the turning point is the epoch when each method drastically decreases the perplexity. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure  2</ref> shows that each method similarly reduces the perplexity at the beginning. AWD-LSTM and AWD-LSTM-MoS were slow to decrease the perplexity from 50 epochs. In contrast, AWD-LSTM-DOC constantly decreased the perplexity and achieved a lower value than the other methods with ordinary SGD. Therefore, we conclude that DOC positively affects the training of language modeling. <ref type="table">Table 6</ref> shows the AWD-LSTM, AWD-LSTMMoS, and AWD-LSTM-DOC results in our configurations. For AWD-LSTM-MoS, we trained our implementation with the same dropout rates as AWD-LSTM-DOC for a fair comparison. AWD-LSTM-DOC outperformed both the original AWD-LSTM-MoS and our implementation. In other words, DOC outperformed MoS.</p><p>Since the averaged SGD uses the averaged parameters from each update step, the parameters of the early steps are harmful to the final parameters. Therefore, when the model converges, recent studies and ours eliminate the history of and then retrains the model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Merity et al. (2018)</ref> referred to this retraining process as fine-tuning. Although most previous studies only conducted fine-tuning once, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zolna et al. (2018)</ref> argued that two finetunings provided additional improvement. Thus, we repeated fine-tuning until we achieved no more improvements in the validation data. We refer to the model as AWD-LSTM-DOC (fin) in <ref type="table">Table 6</ref>, which shows that repeated fine-tunings improved the perplexity by about 0.5. <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Tables 7 and 8</ref> respectively show the perplexities of AWD-LSTM-DOC and previous studies on PTB and WikiText-2 8 . These tables show that AWD-LSTM-DOC achieved the best perplexity. AWD-LSTM-DOC improved the perplexity by almost 2.0 on PTB and 3.5 on WikiText-2 from the state-of-the-art scores. The ensemble technique provided further improvement, as described in previous studies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zaremba et al., 2014;</ref>, and improved the perplexity by at least 4 points on both datasets. Finally, the ensemble of the repeated finetuning models achieved 47.17 on the PTB test and 53.09 on the WikiText-2 test.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Dataset</head><p>We conducted experiments on machine translation and headline generation tasks. For machine translation, we used two kinds of sentence pairs (EnglishGerman and English-French) in the IWSLT 2016 dataset <ref type="bibr">9</ref> . The training set respectively contains about 189K and 208K sentence pairs of EnglishGerman and English-French. We experimented in four settings: from English to German (En-De), its reverse (De-En), from English to French (En-Fr), and its reverse (Fr-En).</p><p>Headline generation is a task that creates a short summarization of an input sentence( <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rush et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rush et al. (2015)</ref> constructed a headline generation dataset by extracting pairs of first sentences of news articles and their headlines from the annotated English Gigaword corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Napoles et al., 2012</ref>). They also divided the extracted sentenceheadline pairs into three parts: training, validation, and test sets. The training set contains about 3.8M sentence-headline pairs. For our evaluation, we used the test set constructed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zhou et al. (2017)</ref> because the one constructed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rush et al.

For this experiment, we modified a publicly available encode-decoder implementation 11 . <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">Table 9</ref> shows the BLEU scores of each method.

Moreover, AWD-LSTM-DOC outperformed AWD-LSTM and AWD-LSTM-MoS. These results correspond to the performance on the language modeling task (Section 5.3). The middle part shows that AWD-LSTM-DOC also outperformed AWD-LSTM and AWD-LSTMMoS in the ensemble setting. In addition, we can improve the performance by exchanging the base parser with a stronger one. In fact, we achieved 94.29 F1 score by reranking the candidates from retrained Recurrent Neural Network Grammars (RNNG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Dyer et al., 2016)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">13</ref> , that achieved 91.2 F1 score in our configuration. Moreover, the lowest row of the middle part indicates the result by reranking the candidates from the retrained neural encoder-decoder based parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Suzuki et al., 2018)</ref>. Our base parser has two different parts from <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Suzuki et al. (2018)</ref>. First, we used the sum of the hidden states of the forward and backward RNNs as the hidden layer for each RNN <ref type="bibr">14</ref> . Second, we tied the embedding matrix to the weight matrix to compute the probability distributions in the decoder. The retrained parser achieved 93.12 F1 score. Finally, we achieved 94.47 F1 score by reranking its candidates with AWD-LSTM-DOC. We expect that we can achieve even better score by replacing the base parser with the current state-of-the-art one <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Kitaev and Klein, 2018</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bengio et al. (2003)</ref> are pioneers of neural language models. To address the curse of dimensionality in language modeling, they proposed a method using word embeddings and a feed-forward neural network <ref type="figure">(FFNN)</ref>. They demonstrated that their approach outperformed n-gram language models, but FFNN can only handle fixed-length contexts. Instead of FFNN, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mikolov et al. (2010</ref><ref type="bibr">) applied RNN (Elman, 1990</ref> to language modeling to address the entire given sequence as a context. Their method outperformed the Kneser-Ney smoothed 5-gram language model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Kneser and Ney, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chen and Goodman, 1996)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Related Work</head><p>Researchers continue to try to improve the performance of RNN language models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Zaremba et al. (2014)</ref> used LSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997</ref>) instead of a simple RNN for language modeling and significantly improved an RNN language model by applying dropout ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Srivastava et al., 2014</ref>) to all the connections except for the recurrent connections. To regularize the recurrent connections, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gal and Ghahramani (2016)</ref> proposed variational inference-based dropout. Their method uses the same dropout mask at each timestep. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zolna et al. (2018)</ref> proposed fraternal dropout, which minimizes the differences between outputs from different dropout masks to be invariant to the dropout mask. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Melis et al. (2018)</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Press and Wolf (2017)</ref> proposed the word tying method (WT), which unifies word embeddings (E in Equation 4) with the weight matrix to compute probability distributions (W in Equation 2). In addition to quantitative evaluation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Inan et al. (2017)</ref> provided a theoretical justification for WT and proposed the augmented loss technique (AL), which computes an objective probability based on word embeddings. In addition to these regularization techniques, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Merity et al. (2018)</ref> used DropConnect ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wan et al., 2013</ref>) and averaged SGD <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Polyak and Juditsky, 1992)</ref> for an LSTM language model. Their AWD-LSTM achieved lower perplexity than <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Melis et al. (2018)</ref> on PTB and WikiText-2.</p><p>Previous studies also explored superior architecture for language modeling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Zilly et al. (2017)</ref> proposed recurrent highway networks that use highway layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Srivastava et al., 2015)</ref> to deepen recurrent connections. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zoph and Le (2017)</ref> adopted reinforcement learning to construct the best RNN structure. However, as mentioned, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Melis et al. (2018)</ref> established that the standard LSTM is superior to these architectures. Apart from RNN architecture,  proposed the input-tooutput gate (IOG), which boosts the performance of trained language models.</p><p>As described in Section 3, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yang et al. (2018)</ref> interpreted training language modeling as matrix factorization and improved performance by computing multiple probability distributions. In this study, we generalized their approach to use the middle layers of RNNs. Finally, our proposed method, DOC, achieved the state-of-the-art score on the standard benchmark datasets.</p><p>Some studies provided methods that boost performance by using statistics obtained from test data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Grave et al.

DOC outperformed MoS and achieved the best perplexities on the standard benchmark datasets of language modeling: PTB and WikiText-2. Moreover, we investigated its effectiveness on machine translation and headline generation. Our results show that DOC also improved the performance of EncDec and using a middle layer positively affected such application tasks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Overview of the proposed method: DOC.
