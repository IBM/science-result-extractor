				<p>Preventing feature co-adaptation by encouraging independent contributions from different features often improves classification and regression performance. Dropout training (Hinton et al., 2012) does this by randomly dropping out (zeroing) hidden units and input features during training of neural networks. However, repeatedly sampling a random subset of input features makes training much slower. Based on an examination of the implied objective function of dropout training , we show how to do fast dropout training by sampling from or integrating a Gaussian approximation, instead of doing Monte Carlo optimization of this objective. This approximation , justified by the central limit theorem and empirical evidence, gives an order of magnitude speedup and more stability. We show how to do fast dropout training for classification , regression, and multilayer neural networks. Beyond dropout, our technique is extended to integrate out other types of noise and small image transformations.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Recent work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Hinton et al., 2012</ref>) has shown that preventing feature co-adaptation by dropout training is a promising method for regularization. Applied to neural network training, the idea is to dropout (zero) randomly sampled hidden units and input features during each iteration of optimization. Dropout played an important role in the systems that won recent learning competitions such as ImageNet classification ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Krizhevsky et al., 2012</ref>) and the Merck molecular activity challenge at www.kaggle.com, and improves performance on various tasks. Dropout can be considered another approach to regularization in addition to the widely used parameter shrinkage methods and model averaging. This process lowers the trust in a feature that is only helpful when other specific features are present, since any particular feature may be dropped out and cannot be depended on. Alternatively, the procedure can be seen as averaging over many neural networks with shared weights.</p><p>Other observations of harmful co-adaptation and ways to address them exist in the literature. Naive Bayes, by completely ignoring co-adaptation, performs better than discriminative methods when there is little data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ng &amp; Jordan, 2002)</ref>, and continues to perform better on certain relatively large datasets <ref type="bibr">(Wang &amp; Man- ning, 2012</ref>). In ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Sutton et al., 2006</ref>), it is observed that training involves trade-offs among weights, where the presence of highly indicative features can cause other useful but weaker features to undertrain. They propose feature bagging: training different models on subsets of features that are later combined, an idea further pursued under the name logarithmic opinion pools by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Smith et al., 2005</ref>). Improved performance on Named Entity Recognition and Part-of-Speech Tagging was demonstrated.</p><p>While the effectiveness of these methods in preventing feature co-adaptation has been demonstrated, actually sampling, or training multiple models, make training slower. Moreover, with a dropout rate of p, the proportion of data still not seen after n passes is p n (e.g., 5 passes of the data are required to see 95% of it at p = 0.5). If the data is not highly redundant, and if we make the relevant data only partially observable at random, then the task becomes even harder, and training efficiency may reduce further.</p><p>In this paper, we look at how to achieve the benefit of dropout training without actually sampling, thereby using all the data efficiently. The approach uses a Gaussian approximation that is justified by the central limit theorem and empirical evidence. We show the validity of this approximation and how it can provide an order of magnitude speed-up at training time, while also giving more stability. Fast dropout fits into the general framework of integrating out noise added to the training data <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Matsuoka, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bishop, 1995)</ref>. See (van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Maaten et al., 2013</ref>) for an alternative approach to integrating out noise and a survey of related work from that angle. Their approach is exact for loss functions decomposable by the moment generating function of the independent noise such as the exponential loss and squared error loss. Our approach does not require independence: it can integrate out small transformations that an image classifier should be invariant to. We begin with logistic regression for simplicity, then extend the idea to other loss functions, other noise, and neural networks. Code is provided at the author's website.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">The implied objective function</head><p>We illustrate the idea with logistic regression (LR) given training vector x, and label y ∈ {0, 1}. To train LR with dropout on data with dimension m, first sample z i ∼ Bernoulli(p i ) for i = 1...m. Here p i is the probability of not dropping out input x i . After sampling z = {z i } i=1...m we can compute the stochastic gradient descent (sgd) update as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">∆w = (y − σ(w T D z x))D z x</formula><p>where D z = diag(z) ∈ R m×m , and σ(x) = 1/(1 + e −x ) is the logistic function.</p><p>This update rule, applied over the training data for multiple passes, can be seen as a Monte Carlo approximation to the following gradient:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">∆ ¯ w = E z;zi∼Bernoulli(pi) [(y − σ(w T D z x))D z x] (1)</formula><p>The objective function with the above gradient is the expected conditional log-likelihood of the label given the data with dropped out dimensions indicated by z,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">for y ∼ Bernoulli(σ(w T D z x)))</formula><p>. This is the implied objective function for dropout training:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L(w) = E z [log(p(y|D z x; w)] (2) = E z [y log(σ(w T D z x)) + (1 − y) log(1 − σ(w T D z x))]</formula><p>Since we are just taking an expectation, we still have a convex optimization problem provided that the negative log-likelihood is convex.</p><p>Evaluating the expectation in (1) naively by summing over all possible z has complexity O(2 m m). Rather than directly computing the expectation with respect to z, we propose a variable transformation that allows us to approximately compute the expectation with respect to a simple random variable Y ∈ R, instead of z ∈ {0, 1} m . In the next subsection, we describe an efficient O(m) approximation that is accurate for machine learning applications where w i x i usually come from a unimodal or bounded distribution. As z is repeatedly sampled, the resulting inputs to the top unit are close to being normally distributed.</p><p>We make the observation that evaluating the objective function L(w) involves taking the expectation with respect to the variable Y (z) = w T D z x = m i w i x i z i , a weighted sum of Bernoulli random variables. For most machine learning problems, {w i } typically forms a unimodal distribution centered at 0, {x i } is either unimodal or in a fixed interval. In this case, Y can be well approximated by a normal distribution even for relatively low dimensional data with m = 10. More technically, the Lyapunov condition is generally satisfied for a weighted sum of Bernoulli random variables of the form Y that are weighted by real data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Lehmann, 1998)</ref>. Then, Lyapunov's central limit theorem states that Y (z) tends to a normal distribution as m → ∞ (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 1</ref>). We empirically verify that the approximation is good for typical datasets of moderate dimensions, except when a couple of dimensions dominate all others (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3)</ref>. Finally, let S be the</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">approximating Gaussian (Y d → S) S = E z [Y (z)] + Var[Y (z)] = µ S + σ S (3)</formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">∼ N (0, 1), E z [Y (z)] = m i=1 p i w i x i , and Var [Y (z)] = m i=1 p i (1 − p i )(w i x i ) 2 .</formula><p>In the following subsections, based on the Gaussian assumption above, we present several approximations at different tradeoff points between speed and accuracy. In the end, we present experimental results showing that there is little to no performance loss when using the faster, less accurate approximations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Gradient computation by sampling from the Gaussian</head><p>Given good convergence, we note that drawing samples of the approximating Gaussian S of Y (z), a constant time operation, is much cheaper than drawing samples of Y (z) directly, which takes O(m). This effect is very significant for high dimensional datasets. So without doing much, we can already approximate the objective function (2) m times faster by sampling from S instead of Y (z). Empirically, this approximation is within the variance of the direct MC approximation of <ref type="formula">(2)</ref> by taking 200 samples of z.</p><p>Approximating the gradient introduces a complication when using samples from the Gaussian. The gradient</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">(1) involves not only Y (z) d − → S, but also D z x directly: L(w) = E z [(y − σ(Y (z)))D z x] (4) Let f (Y (z)) = y − σ(Y (z)) and let g(z) = D z x. Naively approximating E z [f (Y (z))g(z)] by either E S [f (S)]E z [g(z)], or worse, by f (E s [S])E z [g(z)</formula><p>] works poorly in terms of both approximation error and final performance. Note that g(z) is a linear function and therefore</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">E z [g(z)] = g(E z [z]) = diag(p)x.</formula><p>A good way to approximate (4) is by analytically taking the expectation with respect to z i and then using a linear approximation to the conditional expectation. More precisely, consider dimension i of the gradient:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">∂L(w) ∂w i = E z [f (Y (z))x i z i ] = zi∈{0,1} p(z i )z i x i E z−i|zi [f (Y (z))] = p(z i = 1)x i E z−i|zi=1 [f (Y (z))] (5) ≈ p i x i E S∼N (µ S ,σ 2 S ) [f (S)] + ∆µ i ∂E S∼N (µ,σ 2 S ) [f (S)] ∂µ µ=µ S + ∆σ 2 i ∂E S∼N (µ S ,σ 2 ) [f (S)] ∂σ 2 σ 2 =σ 2 S = p i x i (α(µ S , σ 2 S ) + ∆µ i β(µ S , σ 2 S ) + ∆σ 2 i γ(µ S , σ 2 S ))</formula><p>where z −i is the collection of all other zs except z i ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">µ S , σ S is defined in (3), ∆µ i = (1 − p i )x i w i , ∆σ 2 i = −p i (1 − p i )x 2</formula><p>i w 2 i are the changes in µ S , σ 2 S due to conditioning on z i . Note that the partial derivatives as well as E S∼N (µ S ,σ 2 S ) [f (S)] only need to be computed once per training case, since they are independent of i. α, β, γ can be computed by drawing K samples from S, taking time O(K) (whereas K samples of Y (z) take time O(mK)). Concretely,</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">α(µ, σ 2 ) = y − E S∼N (0,1) 1 1 + e −µ−σ S S β(µ, σ 2 ) = ∂α(µ,σ 2 ) ∂µ , and γ(µ, σ 2 ) = ∂α(µ,σ 2 ) ∂σ 2</formula><p>can be computed by differentiating inside the expectation.</p><p>One can combine <ref type="formula">(5)</ref> and what we do in <ref type="formula" target="#formula_12">(7)</ref> below to obtain a more accurate yet relatively cheap approximation to the derivative. However, in practice, using only β approximates the derivative to within the variance of successive MC computations of the objective L (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">figure 4</ref>). Empirically, this is 2-30 times faster compared to MC dropout (see <ref type="figure">figure 5</ref> and table 1).</p><p>At a slightly higher loss in accuracy, we can get rid of z completely by re-parameterizing the problem in µ s and σ s and taking derivatives with respect to them instead of approximating the derivative directly. So the objective function (2) becomes</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">L(w) ≈ E S∼N (µ S ,σ S ) [y log(σ(S))+(1−y) log(1−σ(S))]<label>(6)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">A closed-form approximation</head><p>In the binary classification case, we can avoid sampling by tabulating α, β, γ, and their partial derivatives (they are just functions of 2 arguments).

As a result, (9) is also the exact loss function of the original dropout objective if we summed over z i instead. So over the whole dataset of size n, dropout regression has the following equivalent objective:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">L(w) = 1 n n j=0 (ˆ y(w, x (j) ) − y) 2 + λ m i=1 c i w 2 i</formula><p>This is a form of L 2 regularization depending on</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">c i = 1/n n j=1 x (j)2 i</formula><p>so that weights of larger features are regularized more strongly.</p><p>Alternatively, let X ∈ R n×m be the design matrix, then the normal equations for dropout training and ridge regression are, respectively,</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">w = (X T X + λ diag(X T X)) −1 X T y w = (X T X + λI) −1 X T y<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where diag(A) represents the diagonal matrix with the same diagonal as A. The diagonal of X T X is stronger by a multiplicative factor 1 + λ for dropout instead of the additive λI for L 2 . The equivalent value for λ determined by dropout is (1 − p)/p.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Transformation invariance as noise</head><p>More image data can be generated by applying transformations like small translations, rotations, shearing etc. to the original training data. A transformation of magnitude can be approximated locally by its Lie derivative as T α (x) = x + L T,x (Simard et al., 1996). For translation, rotation, shearing, we can generate more data by randomly sampling i ∼ N (0, σ 2 i ) and computing X = x+ i i L i . Notice that w T X is again normally distributed and the techniques presented in this paper can be used to integrate out these transformations without actually generating the transformed data. Here we do not need the central limit theorem and the noise is not independent.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Fast dropout for neural networks</head><p>Dropout training, as originally proposed, was intended for neural networks where hidden units are dropped out, instead of the data. Fast dropout is directly applicable to dropping out the final hidden layer of neural networks. In this section, we approximately extend our technique to deep neural networks and show how they apply to several popular types of hidden units. For the last layer of a neural network, any output unit outlined in section 3 can be used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">The hidden layers</head><p>Under dropout training, each hidden unit takes a random variable as input, and produces a random variable as output. When the number of hidden units is more than 10 or so, we may again approximate their inputs as Gaussians and characterize their outputs by the output means and variances. A complication is that the inputs to hidden units have a covariance as shown in <ref type="figure">figure 2</ref>.</p><p>Consider any hidden unit in dropout training. We may approximate its input as a Gaussian variable X ∼ N (x|µ, s 2 ), and let its output mean and variance be ν and τ 2 .

Sigmoid squared can be approximated by a translatedscaled version of the sigmoid:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">τ 2 = Var X∼N (µ,s 2 ) [σ(X)] = E[σ(X) 2 ] − E[σ(X)] 2 ≈ E[σ(a(X − b))] − E[σ(X)] 2</formula><p>Figure 2.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Training with backpropagation</head><p>The resulting neural network can be trained by backpropagation with two sets of partial derivatives.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Relation to Bayesian model selection</head><p>Once we make the Gaussian approximation, there is an alternative interpretation of where the variance comes from. In the dropout framework, the variance comes from the dropout variable z.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2.">Experiments on document classification</head><p>We show the performance of fast dropout LR on several sentiment and topic document classification tasks, both accuracy and time taken, in the top half of table 1. Sampling from the Gaussian is generally around 10 times faster than MC dropout and performs comparably to NBSVM in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Wang &amp; Manning, 2012)</ref>, which is a method specifically engineered for document classification. Further speedup is achieved by directly optimizing the objective in <ref type="bibr">(8)</ref> and that is only 30% slower than plain logistic regression. While each iteration of fast dropout is still slower than LR, fast dropout sometimes reaches a better validation performance in less time as seen in <ref type="figure">figure 5</ref>. Note that for the MPQA dataset where the average number of non-zero dimensions is m ≈ 4, the Gaussian assumption is unjustifiable, but the derived method works empirically anyways. We compare to other papers in the bottom half  of the table 1, using either a test/train split or Nfold cross validation, depending on what is the most standard for the dataset. With the right regularization parameters and bigram features, our plain LR baseline is itself quite strong relative to previous work.</p></div>

Here is a case where the data is fairly redundant so that dropping out input features does not make the problem much harder and MC dropout on minibatches converges fairly quickly. We replicate the original experiment using the exact settings described in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Hinton et al., 2012</ref>) with a 20% dropout of the inputs, an exponentially decaying learning rate, a momentum schedule, and minibatch stochastic gradient descent. Under the learning schedule in the original experiment, no improvement resulted from doing fast dropout in the minibatch setting. In fact, each minibatch of fast dropout takes 1.5 times as much time as real dropout with 1 sample. However, the fast dropout objective is suitable for standard optimization technology, and we were able to train faster using L-BFGS where it converged in less than 100 epochs as opposed to over 500 epochs (see <ref type="figure">figure 6</ref>). 160 errors is the previous best result without pre-training or weightsharing or enhancement of the training data.

Validation errors vs. epochs: we used the exact SGD training schedule described in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Hinton et al., 2012</ref>) and a 784-800-800-10 2-hiden-layer neural network. This training schedule is presumably tuned for real dropout. fast dropout performs similarly to real dropout but with less variance. fast dropout batch: use batch L-BFGS and fast dropout, with validation error evaluated every 10 epochs.</p></div>

For high dimensional datasets (over a few hundred), each iteration of fast dropout is less than 2 times slower than normal training. We provided a deterministic and easy-to-compute objective function approximately equivalent to that of real dropout training. One can optimize this objective using standard optimization  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Full Scale D1 D10 D100 FD  MNIST number of errors  Test  129  108 199 118  105 103  Train  4  1  36  1  1  1  Time(s)  10  10  13 110 1.1K  16  CIFAR-10 percent error  Test  53  47  51  45  43  44  Train  42  35  42  33  32  33  Time(s)  17  23  25 230 2.2K  29   Table 3</ref>.

Furthermore, since fast dropout is not losing any information in individual training cases from sampling, it is capable of doing more work in each iteration, often reaching the same validation set performance in a shorter time and in less iterations.</p></div>

6.4. The test time utility of fast dropout 

For the case of real dropout, at test time, Hinton 
et al. (2012) propose using all features, with weights 
scaled by p. This weight scaling heuristic does not 

exactly match the training objective being optimized, 
but greatly speeds run time performance. If we are not 
concerned about run time, we can still apply dropout 
at test time. 

In contrast, the test time procedure for fast dropout is 
exactly the same as the training time procedure. One 
shortcoming of fast dropout is that the implementation 
of training does become more complicated, mainly in 
the backpropagation stage, while the forward compu-
tation of the network function is still straightforward. 

One compromise here is to use fast dropout at test 
time, even if we want to train with real dropout for </table></figure>
