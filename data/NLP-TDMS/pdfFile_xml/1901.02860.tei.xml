				<p>Transformer networks have a potential of learning longer-term dependency, but are limited by a fixed-length context in the setting of language modeling. As a solution, we propose a novel neural architecture, Transformer-XL, that enables Transformer to learn dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. Concretely, it consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the problem of context fragmentation. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is about 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformer during evaluation. Additionally, we improve the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results of bpc/perplexity from 1.06 to 0.99 on enwiki8, from 1.13 to 1.08 on text8, from 20.5 to 18.3 on WikiText-103, from 23.7 to 21.8 on One Billion Word, and from 55.3 to 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). Our code, pretrained models, and hyperparameters are available in both Tensorflow and PyTorch 1 .</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Language modeling is among the important problems that require modeling long-term dependency, with successful applications such as unsupervised pretraining <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dai &amp; Le, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Peters et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Radford et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Devlin et al., 2018)</ref>. However, it has been a challenge to equip neural networks with the capability to model long-term dependency in sequential data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), in particular Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hochreiter &amp; Schmidhuber, 1997)</ref>, have been a standard solution to language modeling and obtained strong results on multiple benchmarks. Despite the wide adaption, RNNs are difficult to optimize due to gradient vanishing and explosion <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hochreiter et al., 2001)</ref>, and the introduction of gating in LSTMs and the gradient clipping technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Graves, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Pascanu et al., 2012</ref>) might not be sufficient to fully address this issue. Empirically, previous work has found that LSTM language models use 200 context words on average ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Khandelwal et al., 2018)</ref>, indicating room for further improvement.</p><p>On the other hand, the direct connections between long-distance word pairs baked in attention mechanisms might ease optimization and enable the learning of long-term dependency ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bahdanau et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref>. Recently, Al-Rfou et al. (2018) designed a set of auxiliary losses to train deep Transformer networks for character-level language modeling, which outperform LSTMs by a large margin. Despite the success, the LM training in Al- <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Rfou et al. (2018)</ref> is performed on separated fixed-length segments of a few hundred characters, without any information flow across segments. As a consequence of the fixed context length, the model cannot capture any longer-term dependency beyond the predefined context length. In addition, the fixed-length segments are created by selecting a consecutive chunk of symbols without respecting the sentence or any other semantic boundary. Hence, the model lacks necessary contextual information needed to well predict the first few symbols, leading to inefficient optimization and inferior performance. We refer to this problem as context fragmentation.</p><p>To address the aforementioned limitations of fixed-length contexts, we propose a new architecture called Transformer-XL (meaning extra long). We introduce the notion of recurrence into our deep self-attention network. In particular, instead of computing the hidden states from scratch for each new segment, we reuse the hidden states obtained in previous segments. The reused hidden states serve as memory for the current segment, which builds up a recurrent connection between the segments. As a result, modeling very long-term dependency becomes possible because information can be propagated through the recurrent connections. Meanwhile, passing information from the previous segment can also resolve the problem of context fragmentation. More importantly, we show the necessity of using relative positional encodings rather than absolute ones, in order to enable state reuse without causing temporal confusion. Hence, as an additional technical contribution, we introduce a simple but more effective relative positional encoding formulation that generalizes to attention lengths longer than the one observed during training.</p><p>Transformer-XL obtained strong results on five datasets, varying from word-level to character-level language modeling. Transformer-XL improves the previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) results from 1.06 to 0.99 in bpc on enwiki8, from 1.13 to 1.08 in bpc on text8, from 20.5 to 18.3 in perplexity on WikiText-103, and from 23.7 to 21.8 in perplexity on One Billion Word. On small data, Transformer-XL also achieves a perplexity of 54.5 on Penn Treebank without finetuning, which is SoTA when comparable settings are considered.</p><p>We use two methods to quantitatively study the effective lengths of Transformer-XL and the baselines. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Khandelwal et al. (2018)</ref>, we gradually increase the attention length at test time until no further noticeable improvement (∼0.1% relative gains) can be observed. Our best model in this settings use attention lengths of 1,600 and 3,800 on WikiText-103 and enwiki8 respectively. In addition, we devise a metric called Relative Effective Context Length (RECL) that aims to perform a fair comparison of the gains brought by increasing the context lengths for different models. In this setting, Transformer-XL learns a RECL of 900 words on WikiText-103, while the numbers for recurrent networks and Transformer are only 500 and 128.</p></div>

Different from them, our work is based on the Transformer architecture and shows that language modeling as a real-world task benefits from the ability to learn longer-term dependency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">MODEL</head><p>Given a corpus of tokens x = (x 1 , . . . , x T ), the task of language modeling is to estimate the joint probability P (x), which is often auto-regressively factorized as P (x) = t P (x t | x &lt;t ). With the factorization, the problem reduces to estimating each conditional factor. In this work, we stick to the standard neural approach to modeling the conditional probability. Specifically, a trainable neural network is used to encode the context x &lt;t into a fixed size hidden state, which is multiplied with the word embeddings to obtain the logits. The logits are then fed into the Softmax function, yielding a categorical probability distribution over the next token.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">VANILLA TRANSFORMER LANGUAGE MODELS</head><p>In order to apply Transformer or self-attention to language modeling, the central problem is how to train a Transformer to effectively encode an arbitrarily long context into a fixed size representation. Given infinite memory and computation, a simple solution would be to process the entire context sequence using an unconditional Transformer decoder, similar to a feed-forward neural network. However, this is usually infeasible with the limited resource in practice.  One feasible but crude approximation is to split the entire corpus into shorter segments of manageable sizes, and only train the model within each segment, ignoring all contextual information from previous segments. This is the idea adopted by Al- <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Rfou et al. (2018)</ref>. We call it the vanilla model and visualize it in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1a</ref>. Under this training paradigm, information never flows across segments in either the forward or backward pass. There are two critical limitations of using a fixed-length context. First, the largest possible dependency length is upper bounded by the segment length, which is a few hundred on character-level language modeling (Al- <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Rfou et al., 2018</ref>). Therefore, although the self-attention mechanism is less affected by the vanishing gradient problem compared to RNNs, the vanilla model is not able to fully exploit this optimization advantage. Second, though it is possible to use padding to respect the sentence or other semantic boundaries, in practice it has been standard practice to simply chunk long text into fixed-length segments due to improved efficiency ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Peters et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Devlin et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Al-Rfou et al., 2018)</ref>. However, simply chunking a sequence into fixed-length segments will lead to the context fragmentation problem as discussed in Section 1.</p><p>During evaluation, at each step, the vanilla model also consumes a segment of the same length as in training, but only makes one prediction at the last position. Then, at the next step, the segment is shifted to the right by only one position, and the new segment has to be processed all from scratch. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1b</ref>, this procedure ensures that each prediction utilizes the longest possible context exposed during training, and also relieves context fragmentation issue encountered in training. However, this evaluation procedure is extremely expensive. We will show that our proposed architecture is able to substantially improve the evaluation speed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">SEGMENT-LEVEL RECURRENCE WITH STATE REUSE</head><p>To address the limitations of using a fixed-length context, we propose to introduce a recurrence mechanism to the Transformer architecture. During training, the hidden state sequence computed for the previous segment is fixed and cached to be reused as an extended context when the model processes the next new segment, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2a</ref>. Although the gradient still remains within a segment, this additional input allows the network to exploit information in the history, leading to an ability of modeling longer-term dependency and avoiding context fragmentation. Formally, let the two consecutive segments of length L be</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">s τ = [x τ,1 , · · · , x τ,L ] and s τ +1 = [x τ +1,1 , · · · , x τ +1,L ]</formula><p>respectively. Denoting the n-th layer hidden state sequence produced for the τ -th segment s τ by h n τ ∈ R L×d , where d is the hidden dimension. Then, the n-th layer hidden state for segment s τ +1  is produced (schematically) as follows,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">h n−1 τ +1 = [SG(h n−1 τ ) • h n−1 τ +1 ], (extended context) q n τ +1 , k n τ +1 , v n τ +1 = h n−1 τ +1 W q , h n−1 τ +1 W k , h n−1 τ +1 W v , (query, key, value vectors) h n τ +1 = Transformer-Layer q n τ +1 , k n τ +1 , v n τ +1 . (self-attention + feed-forward)</formula><p>where the function SG(·) stands for stop-gradient, the notation [h u • h v ] indicates the concatenation of two hidden sequences along the length dimension, and W · denotes model parameters. Compared to the standard Transformer, the critical difference lies in that the key k n τ +1 and value v n τ +1 are conditioned on the extended context h n−1 τ +1 and hence h n−1 τ cached from the previous segment. We emphasize this particular design by the green paths in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2a</ref>.</p><p>With this recurrence mechanism applied to every two consecutive segments of a corpus, it essentially creates a segment-level recurrence in the hidden states. As a result, the effective context being utilized can go way beyond just two segments. However, notice that the recurrent dependency between h n τ +1 and h n−1 τ shifts one layer downwards per-segment, which differs from the same-layer recurrence in conventional RNN-LMs. Consequently, the largest possible dependency length grows linearly w.r.t. the number of layers as well as the segment length, i.e., O(N × L), as visualized by the shaded area in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2b</ref>. This is analogous to truncated BPTT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Mikolov et al., 2010</ref>), a technique developed for training RNN-LMs. However, different from truncated BPTT, our method caches a sequence of hidden states instead of the last one, and should be applied together with the relative positional encoding technique described in Section 3.3.</p><p>Besides achieving extra long context and resolving fragmentation, another benefit that comes with the recurrence scheme is significantly faster evaluation. Specifically, during evaluation, the representations from the previous segments can be reused instead of being computed from scratch as in the case of the vanilla model. In our experiments on enwiki8, Transformer-XL is up to 1,800+ times faster than the vanilla model during evaluation (see Section 4).</p><p>Finally, notice that the recurrence scheme does not need to be restricted to only the previous segment. In theory, we can cache as many previous segments as the GPU memory allows, and reuse all of them as the extra context when processing the current segment. Thus, we can cache a predefined length-M old hidden states spanning (possibly) multiple segments, and refer to them as the memory m n τ ∈ R M ×d , due to a clear connection to the memory augmented neural networks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Graves et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Weston et al., 2014</ref>). In our experiments, we set M equal to the segment length during training, and increase it by multiple times during evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">RELATIVE POSITIONAL ENCODINGS</head><p>While we found the idea presented in the previous subsection very appealing, there is a crucial technical challenge we haven't solved in order to reuse the hidden states. That is, how can we keep the positional information coherent when we reuse the states? Recall that, in the standard Transformer, the information of sequence order is provided by a set of positional encodings, denoted as U ∈ R Lmax×d , where the i-th row U i corresponds to the i-th absolute position within a segment and L max prescribes the maximum possible length to be modeled. Then, the actual input to the Transformer is the element-wise addition of the word embeddings and the positional encodings. If we simply adapt this positional encoding to our recurrence mechanism introduced above, the hidden state sequence would be computed schematically by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">h τ +1 = f (h τ , E sτ+1 + U 1:L ) and h τ = f (h τ −1 , E sτ + U 1:L ),</formula><p>where E sτ ∈ R L×d is the word embedding sequence of s τ , and f represents a transformation function. Notice that, both E sτ and E sτ+1 are associated with the same positional encoding U 1:L . As a result, the model has no information to distinguish the positional difference between x τ,j and x τ +1,j for any j = 1, . . . , L, resulting in a sheer performance loss.</p><p>In order to avoid this failure mode, the fundamental idea is to only encode the relative positional information in the hidden states. Conceptually, the positional encoding gives the model a temporal clue or "bias" about how information should be gathered, i.e., where to attend. For the same purpose, instead of incorporating bias statically into the initial embedding, one can inject the same information into the attention score of each layer. More importantly, it is more intuitive and generalizable to define the temporal bias in a relative manner. For instance, when a query vector q τ,i attends on the key vectors k τ,≤i , it does not need to know the absolute position of each key vector to identify the temporal order of the segment. Instead, it suffices to know the relative distance between each key vector k τ,j and itself q τ,i , i.e. i − j. Practically, one can create a set of relative positional encodings R ∈ R Lmax×d , where the i-th row R i indicates a relative distance of i between two positions. By injecting the relative distance dynamically into the attention score, the query vector can easily distinguish the representations of x τ,j and x τ +1,j from their different distances, making the state reuse mechanism feasible. Meanwhile, we won't lose any temporal information, as the absolute position can be recovered recursively from relative distances.</p><p>Previously, the idea of relative positional encodings has been explored in the context of machine translation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Shaw et al., 2018</ref>) and music generation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Huang et al., 2018</ref>). Here, we offer a different derivation, arriving at a new form of relative positional encodings, which not only has a one-to-one correspondence to its absolute counterpart but also enjoys much better generalization empirically (see Section 4). Firstly, in the standard Transformer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref>, the attention score between query q i and key vector k j within the same segment can be decomposed as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">A abs i,j = q i k j = E xi W q W k E xj (a) + E xi W q W k U j (b) + U i W q W k E xj (c) + U i W q W k U j (d)</formula><p>.</p><p>Following the idea of only relying on relative positional information, we propose to re-parameterize the four terms as follows</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">A rel i,j = E xi W q W k,E E xj (a) + E xi W q W k,R R i−j (b) + u W k,E E xj (c) + v W k,R R i−j (d)</formula><p>.</p><p>• The first change we make is to replace all appearances of the absolute positional embedding U j for computing key vectors in term (b) and (d) with its relative counterpart R i−j . This essentially reflects the prior that only the relative distance matters for where to attend. Note that R is a sinusoid encoding matrix ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Vaswani et al., 2017</ref>) without learnable parameters.</p><p>• Secondly, we introduce a trainable parameter u ∈ R d to replace the query U i W q in term (c). In this case, since the query vector is the same for all query positions, it suggests that the attentive bias towards different words should remain the same regardless of the query position. With a similar reasoning, a trainable parameter v ∈ R d is added to substitute U i W q in term (d).</p><p>• Finally, we deliberately separate the two weight matrices W k,E and W k,R for producing the content-based key vectors and location-based key vectors respectively.</p><p>Under the new parameterization, each term has an intuitive meaning: term (a) represents contentbased addressing, term (b) captures a content-dependent positional bias, term (c) governs a global content bias, and (d) encodes a global positional bias.</p><p>In comparison, the formulation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Shaw et al. (2018)</ref> only has terms (a) and (b), dropping the two bias terms (c) and (d). Moreover, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Shaw et al. (2018)</ref> merge the multiplication W k R into a single trainable matrixˆRmatrixˆ matrixˆR, which abandons the inductive bias built into the original sinusoid positional encoding ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref>. In contrast, our relative positional embedding R adapts the sinusoid formulation. As a benefit of the inductive bias, a model trained on a memory of some certain length can automatically generalize to a memory several times longer during evaluation.</p><p>Equipping the recurrence mechanism with our proposed relative positional embedding, we finally arrive at the Transformer-XL architecture. For completeness, we summarize the computational procedure for a N -layer Transformer-XL with a single attention head below:</p><p>For n = 1, . . . , N :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">h n−1 τ = SG(m n−1 τ ) • h n−1 τ q n τ , k n τ , v n τ = h n−1 τ W n q , h n−1 τ W n k,E , h n−1 τ W n v A n τ,i,j = q n τ,i k n τ,j + q n τ,i W n k,R R i−j + u k τ,j + v W n k,R R i−j a n τ = Masked-Softmax(A n τ )v n τ o n τ = LayerNorm(Linear(a n τ ) + h n−1 τ ) h n τ = Positionwise-Feed-Forward(o n τ )</formula><p>with h 0 τ := E sτ defined as the word embedding sequence. In addition, it is worth mentioning that a naive way to compute A requires computing W n k,R R i−j for all pairs (i, j), whose cost is quadratic w.r.t. the sequence length. However, noticing that the value of i − j only ranges from zero to the sequence length, we show a simple computation procedure in Appendix B, which reduces the cost to be linear w.r.t. the sequence length.    Similar to but different from enwiki8, text8 contains 100M processed Wikipedia characters created by lowering case the text and removing any character other than the 26 letters a through z, and space. Due to the similarity, we simply adapt the best model and the same hyper-parameters on enwiki8 to text8 without further tuning. The comparison with previous methods is summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>. Again, Transformer-XL achieves the new SoTA result with a clear margin.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">ABLATION STUDY</head><p>We conduct two sets of ablation studies to examine the effects of two proposed techniques used in Transformer-XL: the recurrence mechanism and the new positional encoding scheme.</p><p>The first study is performed on WikiText-103, which requires modeling long-term dependency. The results are reported in   short attention lengths during training for better generalization. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref> shows that both the recurrence mechanism and our encoding scheme are necessary to achieve the best performance, as well as generalizing to longer attention sequences during evaluation time. Although the backpropagation length during training is only 128, with the two techniques the attention length can be increased to 640 at test time. In the standard setting with 151M parameters, the perplexity decreases as the attention length increases.</p><p>Since the recurrence mechanism costs additional memory, we also compare Transformer-XL with baselines under the same GPU memory constraints. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 10</ref> in Appendix A, despite using a shorter backpropagation length, Transformer-XL remains superior to the baselines.</p><p>The second study targets at isolating the effects of resolving the context fragmentation problem from the benefit of capturing longer context length. In order to achieve this goal, we deliberately choose a dataset that does not require long-term dependency, so that any improvement from establishing the recurrence can be attributed to solving the context fragmentation. Specifically, we perform this controlled experiment on the One Billion Word dataset, which can only benefit from removing the context fragmentation. We train a 20-layer Transformer-XL with ∼0.3B parameters for 400K steps. As shown in <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>, using segment-level recurrence substantially improves performance even when long-term dependency is not needed, which is consistent with our previous discussion that the recurrence mechanism resolves the context fragmentation problem. Moreover, our relative positional encodings is also superior to Shaw et al. <ref type="formula">(2018)</ref>    <ref type="formula">(2018)</ref>, except that two auxiliary losses are not implemented in our experiments. "PPL init" refers to using the same length as training. "PPL best" indicates the perplexity obtained by using the optimal length. "Attn Len" is the shortest possible attention length during evaluation to achieve the corresponding result (PPL best). Increasing the attention length during evaluation improves performance only when our positional encoding is used. The "Transformer-XL (151M)" setting uses a standard parameter budget as previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Merity et al. (2018)</ref>, where we observe a similar effect when increasing the attention length during evaluation.  <ref type="table">Table 7</ref>: Ablation study on One Billion Word, a dataset without long-term dependency. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Khandelwal et al. (2018)</ref> proposed a method to evaluate the Effective Context Length (ECL) of a sequence model. ECL is the longest length to which increasing the context span would lead to a gain more than a threshold. However, ECL ignores the fact that it is harder to get improvement when a model already achieves a lower perplexity using only a shorter context, and thus it is not suitable for fair comparison among multiple models. We instead propose a new metric called Relative Effective Context Length (RECL). RECL is defined on a model group instead of a single model, and the gain of a long context is measure by the relative improvement over the best short context model. As such, the model group shares the same baseline to enable fair comparison. RECL also has a parameter r, which means constraining the comparison on top-r hard examples. See Appedix C for more details about RECL. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 8</ref>, Transformer-XL manages to model dependency of 900 words long on average with r = 0.1. The RECL of Transformer-XL is 80% and 450% longer than recurrent networks and Transformer respectively. Both the recurrence mechanism and our positional encodings contribute to a longer RECL. This further substantiates our argument that Transformer-XL is able to model longer-term dependency.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We propose a novel architecture, Transformer-XL, for language modeling with self-attention architectures beyond a fixed-length context. Our main technical contributions include introducing the notion of recurrence in a purely self-attentive model and deriving a novel positional encoding scheme. These two techniques form a complete set of solutions, as any one of them alone does not address the issue of fixed-length contexts. Transformer-XL is the first self-attention model that achieves substantially better results than RNNs on both character-level and word-level language modeling. Transformer-XL is also able to model longer-term dependency than RNNs and Transformer, and achieves substantial speedup during evaluation compared to vanilla Transformers.   </p></div>

Hence, the rows of the matrix</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Q :=        R M +L−1 R M +L−2</formula><p>. . .</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">R 1 R 0        W k,R =         [W k,R R M +L−1 ] [W k,R R M +L−2 ]</formula><p>. . .</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">[W k,R R 1 ] [W k,R R 0 ]         ∈ R (M +L)×d</formula><p>consist of all possible vector outputs of W k,R R i−j for any (i, j). Note that we have defined Q in a reversed order, i.e., Q k = W k,R R M +L−1−k , to make further discussion easier.</p><p>Next, we collect the term (b) for all possible i, j into the following</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">L × (M + L) matrix, B =      q 0 W k,R R M · · · q 0 W k,R R 0 0 · · · 0 q 1 W k,R R M +1 · · · q 1 W k,R R 1 q 1 W k,R R 0 · · · 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . q L−1 W k,R R M +L−1 · · · q L−1 W k,R R M +L−1 q L−1 W k,R R L−1 · · · q L−1 W k,R R 0      =      q 0 Q L−1 · · · q 0 Q M +L−1 0 · · · 0 q 1 Q L−2 · · · q 1 Q M +L−2 q 1 Q M +L−1 · · · 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . q L−1 Q 0 · · · q L−1 Q M q L−1 Q M +1 · · · q L−1 Q M +L−1      Then, we further define B = qQ =      q 0 Q 0 · · · q 0 Q M q 0 Q M +1 · · · q 0 Q M +L−1 q 1 Q 0 · · · q 1 Q M q 1 Q M +1 · · · q 1 Q M +L−1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . q L−1 Q 0 · · · q L−1 Q M q L−1 Q M +1 · · · q L−1 Q M +L−1      .</formula><p>Now, it is easy to see an immediate relationship between B and B, where the i-th row of B is simply a left-shifted version of i-th row of B.

In this section, we describe the details of the metric RECL. Let M = {m 1 , m 2 , · · · , m N } be a model group consisting of N models. Let l i (c, t) denote the loss of model m i on the t-th token in the corpus with a context length c. Concretely, the loss can be written as</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C DETAILS ABOUT RECL</head><formula xml:id="formula_13">l i (c, t) = − log P mi (x t |x t−1 , · · · , x t−c )</formula><p>where P mi is the probability distribution given by model m i , and x t is the t-th token in the corpus.

This enables fair comparison between multiple models because all models with a long context length c need to improve over the same baseline.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D ATTENTION VISUALIZATION</head><p>In this section, we provide some visualization of the attention learned by the SoTA model on the WikiText-103 validation set. Recall that, this model has 16 10-head transformer layers and relies on a memory of length 640. The first visualization aims at revealing the overall trend of where the model is attending. Specifically, for each attention head of each layer, we average the attention distributions of all tokens in the validation set. This is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref>. As we can see, the overall trend is to focus more on the nearby tokens than the faraway ones. However, it is also very clear that some attention heads have a wider attention distribution over the entire memory span, notably the head 8 from layer 1, head 78 from layer 8, and the head 158 from layer 16.</p><p>Since we are focused on learning long-range dependency, we are especially interested in these heads with a wider attention span. Thus, in the second set of visualization, we pick the three notable heads mentioned above, and visualize their attention behavior for a randomly chosen position, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 6</ref>. Here, we see three different patterns of wider attention:</p><p>• For the head 8 in the 1st layer, we see an almost uniform attention over the entire memory span. This is quite intuitive, as lower-level layers needs to screen the entire memory span to decide where to focus for higher-level layers • For the head 78 in the 8th layer (a middle-level layer), we see a very sparse attention pattern scattered in all ranges of the memory. Again, this well fits our intuition that as information accumulates, the network may focus on some particular position with special interests.</p><p>• For the head 158 in the 16th layer (i.e. the last layer), each target location (corresponding to each row) has its own distinct sparse focus, differing from head 78 where target locations largely share the same attentive location in memory. Meanwhile, the pattern is also different from the case of head 8, where a few locations are clearly attended more than others.  Finally, as we have discussed in section 3.3, the attention score can be decomposed into four intuitive terms. Here, we want to further investigate how these four terms contribute to the overall attention trend in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref>. Since the term (c) represents the global content bias, i.e., the prior importance of each word regardless of the context, we will leave it out and focus on the terms (a), (b) and (d). So, for each term, we take the Softmax w.r.t. the memory span and average the resulted distribution of all tokens in the validation set. The results are visualized in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Fig. 7</ref>:</p><p>• Since term (a) is fully content-based addressing, when averaging over all target words, the result is essentially uniform over the entire context, except for a few very close words, which are likely to be semantically similar to the target word.</p><p>• The overall trend of term (b) highly resembles that of the entire attention distribution in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5</ref>.</p><p>It suggests that the global trend of focusing on the nearby context is largely contributed by this content-dependent positional bias.</p><p>• The overall trend of term (d) is also focusing more on nearby words. However, compared to the trend of term (b), it is clearly flatter and biases towards a longer context. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Illustration of the vanilla model with a segment length 4.</figDesc></figure>

We apply Transformer-XL to a variety of datasets on both word-level and character-level language 
modeling to have a comparison with state-of-the-art systems, including WikiText-103 (Merity et al., 
2016), enwiki8 (LLC, 2009), text8 (LLC, 2009), One Billion Word (Chelba et al., 2013), and Penn 
Treebank (Mikolov &amp; Zweig, 2012). 

WikiText-103 is the largest available word-level language modeling benchmark with long-term de-
pendency. It contains 103M training tokens from 28K articles, with an average length of 3.6K tokens 
per article, which allows testing the ability of long-term dependency modeling. We set the attention 
length to 384 during training and 1600 during evaluation. We adopted adaptive softmax and input 
representations (Baevski &amp; Auli, 2018; Grave et al., 2016a). As shown in Table 1, Transformer-XL 
reduces the previous SoTA perplexity from 20.5 to 18.3, which demonstrates the superiority of the 
Transformer-XL architecture. 

The dataset enwiki8 contains 100M bytes of unprocessed Wikipedia text. We compare our architec-
ture with the previous results in Table 2. Under the model size constraint, the 12-layer Transformer-
XL achieves a new SoTA result, outperforming the 12-layer vanilla Transformer from Al-Rfou et al. 
(2018) by 0.05, while both Transformer variants have a large margin over conventional RNN-based 
models. Notably, our 12-layer architecture achieves the same result as the 64-layer network from 
Al-Rfou et al. (2018), using only 17% of the parameter budget. In order to see whether better perfor-
mances can be obtained by increasing the model size, we train 18-layer and 24-layer Transformer-
XLs with increased model sizes. With the attention length 784 during training and 3,800 during 
evaluation, we obtained a new SoTA result and our method is the first to break through 1.0 on </table></figure>
