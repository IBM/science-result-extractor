			<abstract>
				<p>We combine two of the most popular approaches to automated Grammatical Error Correction (GEC): GEC based on Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and GEC based on Neural Machine Translation (NMT). The hybrid system achieves new state-of-the-art results on the CoNLL-2014 and JFLEG benchmarks. This GEC system preserves the accuracy of SMT output and, at the same time, generates more fluent sentences as it typical for NMT. Our analysis shows that the created systems are closer to reaching human-level performance than any other GEC system reported so far.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Currently, the most effective GEC systems are based on phrase-based statistical machine translation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rozovskaya and Roth, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Junczys- Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chollampatt and Ng, 2017)</ref>. Systems that rely on neural machine translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Yuan and Briscoe, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Xie et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Schmaltz et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ji et al., 2017)</ref> are not yet able to achieve as high performance as SMT systems according to automatic evaluation metrics (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for comparison on the CoNLL-2014 test set). However, it has been shown that the neural approach can produce more fluent output, which might be desirable by human evaluators ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Napoles et al., 2017)</ref>. In this work, we combine both MT flavors within a hybrid GEC system. Such a GEC system preserves the accuracy of SMT output and at the same time generates more fluent sentences achieving new state-of-the-art results on two different benchmarks: the annotationbased CoNLL-2014 and the fluency-based JFLEG benchmark. Moreover, comparison with human gold standards shows that the created systems are closer to reaching human-level performance than any other GEC system described in the literature so far. Using consistent training data and preprocessing ( § 2), we first create strong SMT ( § 3) and NMT ( § 4) baseline systems. Then, we experiment with system combinations through pipelining and reranking ( § 5). Finally, we compare the performance with human annotations and identify issues with current state-of-the-art systems ( § 6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Data and preprocessing</head><p>Our main training data is NUCLE ( <ref type="bibr">Dahlmeier et al., 2013)</ref>. English sentences from the publicly available Lang-8 Corpora ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Mizumoto et al., 2012</ref>) serve as additional training data.</p><p>We use official test sets from two CoNLL shared tasks from <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ng et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, 2014</ref>) as development and test data, and evaluate using M 2 <ref type="bibr">(Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012</ref>). We also report results on JFLEG ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Napoles et al., 2017</ref>) with the  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Tokens   NUCLE  57,151  1,162K  Lang-8 NAIST  1,943,901 25,026K  CoNLL-2013 (dev)  1,381  29K  CoNLL-2014 (test)  1,312  30K  JFLEG Dev  754  14K  JFLEG Test  747  13K   Table 1</ref>: Statistics for training and testing data sets.</p><p>GLEU metric ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Napoles et al., 2015)</ref>. The data set is provided with a development and test set split. All data sets are listed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>We preprocess Lang-8 with the NLTK tokenizer ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bird and Loper, 2004</ref>) and preserve the original tokenization in NUCLE and JFLEG. Sentences are truecased with scripts from Moses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Koehn et al., 2007)</ref>. For dealing with out-of-vocabulary words, we split tokens into 50k subword units using Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sennrich et al. (2016b)</ref>. BPE codes are extracted only from correct sentences from Lang-8 and NUCLE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">SMT systems</head><p>For our SMT-based systems, we follow recipes proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Junczys-Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz (2016)</ref>, and use a phrase-based SMT system with a log-linear combination of task-specific features. We use word-level Levenshtein distance and edit operation counts as dense features (Dense), and correction patterns on words with one word left/right context on Word Classes (WC) as sparse features (Sparse). We also experiment with additional character-level dense features (Char. ops). All systems use a 5-gram Language Model (LM) and OSM <ref type="bibr">(Durrani et al., 2011</ref>) both estimated from the target side of the training data, and a 5-gram LM and 9-gram WCLM trained on Common Crawl data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Buck et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>Experiment settings Translation models are trained with Moses ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Koehn et al., 2007)</ref>, wordalignment models are produced with MGIZA++ ( <ref type="bibr">Gao and Vogel, 2008)</ref>, and no reordering models are used. Language models are built using KenLM <ref type="bibr">(Heafield, 2011)</ref>, while word classes are trained with word2vec <ref type="bibr">1</ref> .</p><p>We tune the systems separately for M 2 and GLEU metrics. MERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Och, 2003</ref>  we follow the 4-fold cross-validation on NUCLE with adapted error rate recommended by JunczysDowmunt and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Grundkiewicz (2016)</ref>. Models evaluated on GLEU are optimized on JFLEG Dev using the GLEU scorer, which we added to Moses. We report results for models using feature weights averaged over 4 tuning runs.</p><p>Results Other things being equal, using the original tokenization, applying subword units, and extending edit-based features result in a similar system to Junczys-Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz (2016): 49.82 vs 49.49 M 2 ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2)</ref>.</p><p>The phrase-based SMT systems do not deal well with orthographic errors ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Napoles et al., 2017</ref>) -if a source word has not been seen in the training corpus, it is likely copied as a target word. Subword units can help to solve this problem partially. Adding features based on character-level edit counts increases the results on both test sets.</p><p>A result of 55.79 GLEU on JFLEG Test is already 2 points better than the GLEU-tuned NMT system of  and only 1 point worse than the best reported result by Chollampatt and Ng (2017) with their M 2 -tuned SMT system, even though no additional spelling correction has been used at this point. We experiment with specialized spell-checking methods in later sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">NMT systems</head><p>The model architecture we choose for our NMTbased systems is an attentional encoder-decoder model with a bidirectional single-layer encoder and decoder, both using GRUs as their RNN variants ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sennrich et al., 2017)</ref>. A similar architecture has been already tested for the GEC task by , but we use different hyperparameters.</p><p>To improve the performance of our NMT models, similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Xie et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Ji et al. (2017)</ref>, we combine them with an additional large-scale language model. In contrast to previous studies, which use an n-gram probabilistic LM, we build a 2-layer Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNN  LM) with GRU cells which we train again on English Common Crawl data <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Buck et al., 2014</ref>).</p><p>Experimental settings We train with the Marian toolkit (Junczys-Dowmunt et al., 2018) on the same data we used for the SMT baselines, i.e. NUCLE and Lang-8. The RNN hidden state size is set to 1024, embedding size to 512. Source and target vocabularies as well as subword units are the same.</p><p>Optimization is performed with Adam ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Kingma and Ba, 2014</ref>) and the mini-batch size fitted into 4GB of GPU memory. We regularize the model with scaling dropout ( <ref type="bibr">Gal and Ghahramani, 2016</ref>) with a dropout probability of 0.2 on all RNN inputs and states. Apart from that we dropout entire source and target words with probabilities of 0.2 and 0.1 respectively. We use early stopping with a patience of 10 based on the cross-entropy cost on the CoNLL-2013 test set. Models are validated and saved every 10,000 mini-batches. As final models we choose the one with the best performance on the development set among the last ten model check-points based on the M 2 or GLEU metrics.</p><p>Size of RNN hidden state and embeddings, target vocabulary, and optimization options for the RNN LM are identical to those used for our NMT models. Decoding is done by beam search with a beam size of 12. We normalize scores for each hypothesis by sentence length.</p><p>Results A single NMT model achieves lower performance than the SMT baselines <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 3)</ref>. However, the M 2 score of 42.76 for CoNLL-2014 is already higher than the best published result of 41.53 M 2 for a strictly neural GEC system of Ji and thus boosts the results significantly on both test sets (+5.8 M 2 and +5.96 GLEU).</p><p>An ensemble of four independently trained models 3 (NMT×4), on the other hand, increases precision at the expense of recall, which may even lead to a performance drop. Adding the RNN LM to that ensemble balances this negative effect, resulting in 50.19 M 2 . These are by far the highest results reported on both benchmarks for pure neural GEC systems.</p><p>Comparison to SMT systems With model ensembling, the neural systems achieve performance similar to SMT baselines <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2)</ref>. A strippeddown SMT system without CCLM, quite surprisingly gives better results on JFLEG than the NMT system, and the opposite is true for CoNLL-2014. The reason for the lower performance on JFLEG might be a large amount of spelling errors, which are more efficiently corrected by the SMT system using subword units.</p><p>If both systems are enhanced by a large-scale language model, the neural system outperforms the SMT system on JFLEG and it is competitive with SMT systems on CoNLL-2014. However, it is not known if the results would preserve if the NMT model is combined with a probabilistic ngram LM instead as it has been proposed in the previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Xie et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ji et al., 2017</ref>  <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>: Results for hybrid SMT-NMT systems on the CoNLL-2014 (M 2 ) and JFLEG Test (GLEU) sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Hybrid SMT-NMT systems</head><p>We experiment with pipelining and rescoring methods in order to combine our best SMT and NMT GEC systems 4 .</p><p>SMT-NMT pipelines The output corrected by an SMT system is passed as an input to the NMT ensemble with or without RNN LM 5 . In this case the NMT system serves as an automatic post-editing system. Pipelining improves the results on both test sets by increasing recall <ref type="table">(Table 4)</ref>. As the performance of the NMT system without a RNN LM is much lower than the performance of the SMT system alone, this implies that both approaches produce complementary corrections.</p><p>Rescoring with NMT Rescoring of an n-best list obtained from one system by another is a commonly used technique in GEC, which allows to combine multiple different systems or even different approaches <ref type="bibr">(Hoang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Yannakoudakis et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chollampatt and Ng, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ji et al., 2017)</ref>. In our experiments, we generate a 1000 n-best list with the SMT system and add separate scores from each neural component. Scores of NMT models and the RNN LM are added in the form of probabilities in negative log space. The re-scored weights are obtained from a single run of the Batch Mira algorithm (Cherry and Foster, 2012) on the development set.</p><p>As opposed to pipelining, rescoring improves precision at the expense of recall and is more effective for the CoNLL data resulting in up to 54.95 M 2 . On JFLEG, rescoring only with the RNN LM <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The best system combinations are chosen again based on the development sets, i.e. CoNLL-2013 and JFLEG Dev. We omit these results as they are highly overestimated. <ref type="bibr">5</ref> We did not observed any improvements if the order of the systems is reversed.  produces similar results as rescoring with the NMT ensemble. However, the best result for rescoring is lower than for pipelining on that test set. It seems the SMT system is not able to produce as diversified corrections in an n-best list as those generated by the NMT ensemble.</p><p>Spelling correction and final results Pipelining the NMT-rescored SMT system and the NMT system leads to further improvement. We believe this can be explained by different contributions to precision and recall trade-offs for the two methods, similar to effects observed for the combination of the NMT ensemble and our RNN LM.</p><p>On top of our final hybrid system we add a spellchecking component, which is run before pipelining. We use a character-level SMT system following Chollampatt and Ng (2017) which they deploy for unknown words in their word-based SMT system. As our BPE-based SMT does not really suffer from unknown words, we run the spell-checking component on words that would have been segmented by the BPE algorithm. This last system achieves the best results reported in this paper: 56.25 M 2 on CoNLL-2014 and 61.50 GLEU on JFLEG Test.</p></div>

The SMT and NMT systems produce different corrections. Rescoring is able to generate a unique correction (is change→has changed), but it fails in generating some corrections from the neural system, e.g. misspellings (becom and dificullty). Pipelining, on the other hand, may not improve a local correction made by the SMT system (is changed).
