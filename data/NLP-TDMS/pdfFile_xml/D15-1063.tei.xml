			<abstract>
				<p>Temporal taggers are usually developed for a certain language. Besides English, only few languages have been addressed, and only the temporal tagger HeidelTime covers several languages. While this tool was manually extended to these languages , there have been earlier approaches for automatic extensions to a single target language. In this paper, we present an approach to extend HeidelTime to all languages in the world. Our evaluation shows promising results, in particular considering that our approach neither requires language skills nor training data, but results in a baseline tagger for 200+ languages.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction &amp; Related Work</head><p>Temporal tagging (the extraction and normalization of temporal expressions) is a crucial task in NLP, and many applications can benefit from temporal information, e.g., in the context of question answering and information retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Campos et al., 2014</ref>). Thus, there has been a lot of research during the last years addressing temporal information extraction, as reflected by manually annotated corpora, approaches to temporal tagging, and research challenges such as the TempEval series ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Verhagen et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">UzZaman et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>While, in the meantime, the range of annotated corpora covers several languages different from English, e.g., the French, Portuguese, Italian, and Romanian TimeBank corpora <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bittar et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Costa and Branco, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Caselli et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Forascu and Tufis, 2012)</ref>, most approaches to temporal tagging focus on processing English text, e.g., DANTE <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Mazur and Dale, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mazur, 2012)</ref> and SUTime ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chang and Manning, 2012)</ref>. Of course, exceptions exist, e.g., TipSem for English and Spanish ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Llorens et al., 2010)</ref>, and HeidelTime ) even covers 13 languages. However, it required a lot of manual effort to extend HeidelTime, and researchers of different institutes and countries have been involved for German <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Strötgen and Gertz, 2011</ref>), Dutch (van de <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Camp and Christiansen, 2012)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Spanish (Strötgen et al., 2013)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">French (Moriceau and Tannier, 2014</ref>), Croatian ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Skukan et al., 2014</ref>), Vietnamese and Arabic ), Italian ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Manfredi et al., 2014</ref>), Chinese ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Li et al., 2014</ref>), Russian, Estonian, and Portuguese.</p><p>Obviously, it is possible to manually extend HeidelTime and thus a temporal tagger in general. However, each language is typically addressed separately, and the extension process is time-and labor-intensive, so that a method to automate this process is desirable. While there have been earlier approaches for automatic extensions of temporal taggers to further languages ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Saquete et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Negri et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Spreyer and Frank, 2008)</ref>, these were limited to a few languages and the results were considered less successful, in particular for the normalization subtask. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Angeli and Uszkoreit (2013)</ref> presented an approach to language-independent parsing of temporal expressions, however, addressing only the normalization and not the extraction subtask.</p><p>In this paper, we re-address the task of automatically extending a temporal tagger to further languages. In contrast to previous work, we address both subtasks of temporal tagging, i.e., the extraction and the normalization, and we do not limit our work to a few selected languages, but we aim at extending HeidelTime to cover all languages in the world. In addition of making use of automatic pattern translations based on Wiktionary, <ref type="bibr">1</ref> we allow for fuzzy matching in the newly addressed languages. This strategy results in promising temporal tagging quality for many languages, although our evaluations show that the quality of a manually extended temporal tagger is not reached, and that there are open issues that need to be addressed for specific language characteristics.</p><p>By making our newly developed resources publicly available, we establish a baseline temporal tagger for basically all languages in the world -for comparison or as starting point for improvements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">HeidelTime</head><p>HeidelTime is a rule-based, domain-sensitive, and publicly available temporal tagger that was developed with multilinguality in mind so that the source code and language-dependent resources are strictly separated, and it can be extended to new languages without modifying its source code ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Input and Output Format</head><p>As input, HeidelTime requires linguistic preprocessed documents with sentence, token, and partof-speech (pos) information -although it is possible to create language resources not making use of pos constraints. For processing news-style documents, a publication date is additionally needed.</p><p>Temporal expressions are annotated following the temporal markup language TimeML <ref type="bibr">(Puste- jovsky et al., 2005</ref>) using TIMEX3 tags with normalization attributes, most importantly type (date, time, duration, set) and value to represent the main semantics of expressions in standard format.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Language-dependent Resources</head><p>Each language requires its own language resources consisting of patterns, normalization information and rules. Pattern files contain terms that are frequently used to form temporal expressions, e.g., for names of months and weekdays or numbers that may refer to a day or year. Regular expressions can be used in the pattern files, and each pattern file is interpreted as a regular expression pattern, which can be called by HeidelTime's rules.</p><p>Normalization files contain normalized information for patterns defined in the pattern files, e.g., that the value of "January" is "01" and that "3" has to be normalized to "03" in case it refers to a day or a month and to "3" in case it refers to a duration.</p><p>Finally, for the four types of temporal expressions (date, time, duration, and set), a rule file contains all rules for respective expressions. In addition to a rule name, the extraction part and the value normalization part are obligatory. The former is a regular expression that may contain any number of references to pattern files, and in the latter, normalization functions are called to normalize respective parts of the extracted expressions. In addition, part-of-speech constraints can be specified, negative rules can be formulated, and offset information can be set, e.g., if parts of the extracted patterns are required context information during the extraction process but not part of the temporal expression itself. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Manual Extension to a New Language</head><p>So far, HeidelTime resources for newly supported languages have been manually created (cf. references is Section 1). For this, the following steps had to be completed: (i) linguistic preprocessing for the new language has been provided, (ii) all patterns in the pattern and normalization files have been manually translated, and (iii) rules have been developed iteratively. Starting with simple rules of the source language (typically English), rules have been adapted and added based on false negatives, false positives, partial matches and incorrect value normalizations on the training data for the new language. Then, more complex rules of the source language have been addressed step-by-step.</p><p>Note that tasks (ii) and (iii) have been carried out by language experts, and task (iii) was performed until no further improvements could be achieved on the training data. In addition to the fact that this process is time-and labor intensive, further disadvantages are that a language expert and temporally annotated training data are required. Finally, languages are typically addressed by different researchers with differing effort so that quality and completeness varies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Automatic Extension to All Languages</head><p>In this section, we present the steps of our automatic extension approach in detail. A graphical summary of our approach is depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Linguistic Preprocessing</head><p>While part-of-speech (pos) information can be helpful to write more general rules and to improve temporal tagging quality, there is no pos tagger covering all languages in the world. In addition,  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Graphical overview of the automated resource development process. Resources A and C are directly added to the resources of all languages; resource B is processed following steps (i) to (iv). the only obligatory linguistic preprocessing steps are sentence splitting and tokenization. Thus, we write a simple and generic, language-independent sentence splitter and tokenizer, which we use for all languages. Note that our tokenization is based on a white-space token boundary assumption so that we have to take care of languages without such token boundaries separately (cf. Section 4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Language-independent Resources</head><p>Some patterns and normalization information are valid for all (many) languages, e.g., numbers for days and months. For such patterns, we write language-independent pattern and normalization resources <ref type="figure">(Figure 1, A)</ref>. These do not contain language-dependent terms and will be part of the resources for each of the languages in the world.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Simplified English Resources</head><p>The main goal of the simplified English resources is to make HeidelTime's original English resources amenable to automatic translation. Thus, rules are addressed in a language-independent fashion (cf. Section 3.4), and the simplified English resources <ref type="figure">(Figure 1, B)</ref> are written as normalization files, from which pattern and normalization files for all languages are derived <ref type="figure">(Figure 1, i-iv)</ref>.</p><p>For terms directly occurring in English rules, new pattern files are created, and all English patterns are written without regular expressions. While this makes the resources longer (original patterns with regular expressions are expanded to many patterns), these simplified resources are necessary for a smooth translation process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Language-independent Rules</head><p>Based on HeidelTime's English resources, we also write completely language-independent rules for date, time, duration, and set expressions. In addition, we add "creative" rules that are not necessary for English expressions but might match expressions in other languages. In particular, we allow several orderings of patterns and sometimes even random tokens in between. For instance, instead of just a "month day" pattern (e.g., to match "January 13"), we add "day month", "day X month" and "month X day", with "X" matching any token (e.g., for the Spanish translation "13 de enero").</p><p>In the extraction and normalization parts of the rules, we refer to the names of the languageindependent and simplified English pattern and normalization files. Note that in contrast to the original rules, these rules do neither contain pos constraints nor any English terms to guarantee language independence. However, fuzzy pattern matching is allowed at the end of some patterns to try to take care of morphology-rich languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Creating Resources for All Languages</head><p>As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, the patterns of the simplified English resources are translated to all languages in the world using Wiktionary as translation resource. For each normalization file, the respective pattern and normalization files for each language in Wiktionary are created (i). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Then, HeidelTime 1.9 (manual) HeidelTime -automatic relaxed extr value relaxed extr value language: corpus / domain P R F1 F1 acc.

These contain translation information that is then added to the pattern and normalization files of the occurring languages by extracting respective translations (iv). Note that for ambiguous words, Wiktionary contains one translation table for each meaning. For instance, there are two translation tables for "November" for the meanings "eleventh month of the Gregorian calendar" and "N in the ICAO spelling alphabet". <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Obviously, it is crucial to use only the translations of the intended meaning. Thus, in the case of multiple meanings of English patterns, we provide the names of Wiktionary's correct translation tables to our translation script, so that only translations of the correct meaning are generated. In addition, if patterns in the new language start with a lower case character, we allow upper case and lower case for the respective character as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1, (iv)</ref>.</p><p>Unfortunately, Wiktionary is of course not complete and does not contain translations to all languages for all English patterns. However, to allow backtracking, we add the English information to the resource files of all languages. If, at a later point, the automatically created resources are used as basis for developing better resources for specific languages, missing translations can be easily detected and manually added.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Improving and Finalizing the Resources</head><p>In particular for the rule development process, we also create the automatic resources for English. These are repeatedly evaluated on the temporally annotated English corpora TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003), TempEval-3 platinum (UzZaman et al., 2013), and WikiWars <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Mazur and Dale, 2010)</ref>. Analyzing the errors on these corpora, we iteratively improve the simplified English resources and the rules. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, we compare HeidelTime's original English resources (HeidelTime 1.9) with the simplified resources (HeidelTime -automatic). While details about evaluation measures will be described in Section 4, the results of the automatic approach are obviously lower, as expected due to the simplification process.</p><p>Resources for all languages are finally built by combining the language-independent resources, the automatically created pattern and normalization files, and the language-independent rules. Note that depending on the completeness of Wiktionary, the coverage of the resources -and thus also their quality -varies between languages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Evaluation</head><p>For a subset of languages, temporally annotated corpora exist. Thus, we can directly evaluate our approach for these languages. For German, Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese, Croatian, Arabic, Vietnamese, and Chinese, we compare our automatic approach with HeidelTime's manually developed resources. In addition, first results are reported for Romanian.   For all other languages, it is obviously difficult to judge the temporal tagging quality of the newly developed resources. However, for an estimation of the quality for languages without temporally annotated corpora, we provide completeness statistics of the pattern translations. The fewer translations are available for a language, the more likely it is that the temporal tagging quality is rather low.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>544</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Evaluation Measures</head><p>Since the task of temporal tagging is two-fold, we report precision, recall, and F1-score for the extraction task, and for the full task (relaxed extraction plus value normalization) value F1. Similar as the TempEval-3 organizers ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">UzZaman et al., 2013)</ref>, we consider value F1 with relaxed matching as most important. However, when processing large amounts of data, value accuracy becomes also important. Since it directly shows independent of the recall if extracted expressions are normalized correctly, it is reported, too.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Evaluation Results and Discussion</head><p>As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, the results of our automatically created resources are worse than those of HeidelTime with manually developed resources. For Spanish, German, French, and Portuguese, high precision, moderate recall, and good normalization results are achieved. In contrast, recall for Chinese, Croatian, and Romanian are quite low, precision is low for Romanian, and normalization accuracy for Chinese, Vietnamese and Romanian. Clearly, more work is necessary to achieve temporal tagging quality that can be considered as applicable for other applications. In particular, issues with morphology-rich languages and those without white-space tokenization have to be addressed.</p><p>Nevertheless, the results look promising for several languages taking into account that the resources are developed without any languagespecific information, and that our approach has been the first step towards more sophisticated temporal tagging of all languages in the world. Note that recall is much worse than precision for all languages and that the normalization of extracted expressions works quite well (value acc.).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Completeness Statistics</head><p>To estimate the quality of our automatically created resources for languages without annotated corpora, we create completeness statistics. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">As Fig- ure 2</ref> shows, the completeness differs significantly between languages. However, Wiktionary translations exist for at least 75% and 50% of the patterns for 34 and 83 languages, respectively, and even for many languages with low overall coverage, important patterns such as month names and date words are well-covered. Note that even for languages with few translations, our approach can be considered as baseline since temporal tagging of most languages has not been addressed before.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusions and Ongoing Work</head><p>In this paper, we presented our approach to automatically extend the temporal tagger HeidelTime to all languages in the world. We thus establish new temporal tagging baselines for many languages, and anyone working on any of those languages in the future can either use our resources as a starting point or as a baseline for comparison. The resources for 200+ languages are available with HeidelTime 2.0 at http://github. com/HeidelTime/heideltime.</p><p>Currently, we are improving the simplified English resources and the translation process by exploiting further resources such as Wikipedia. In the future, we thus plan to constantly update HeidelTime's automatically created resources.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>25</head><label>25</label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
