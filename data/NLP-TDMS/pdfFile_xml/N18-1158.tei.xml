				<p>Single document summarization is the task of producing a shorter version of a document while preserving its principal information content. In this paper we conceptualize extractive summarization as a sentence ranking task and propose a novel training algorithm which globally optimizes the ROUGE evaluation metric through a reinforcement learning objective. We use our algorithm to train a neu-ral summarization model on the CNN and Dai-lyMail datasets and demonstrate experimentally that it outperforms state-of-the-art extrac-tive and abstractive systems when evaluated automatically and by humans. 1</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Automatic summarization has enjoyed wide popularity in natural language processing due to its potential for various information access applications. Examples include tools which aid users navigate and digest web content (e.g., news, social media, product reviews), question answering, and personalized recommendation engines. Single document summarization -the task of producing a shorter version of a document while preserving its information content -is perhaps the most basic of summarization tasks that have been identified over the years (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Nenkova and McKeown, 2011</ref> for a comprehensive overview).</p><p>Modern approaches to single document summarization are data-driven, taking advantage of the success of neural network architectures and their ability to learn continuous features without recourse to preprocessing tools or linguistic annotations. Abstractive summarization involves various text rewriting operations (e.g., substitution, deletion, reordering) and has been recently framed as a sequence-to-sequence problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Sutskever et al., 2014</ref>). Central in most approaches ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Rush et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Nallapati et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">See et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Tan and Wan, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Paulus et al., 2017</ref>) is an encoder-decoder architecture modeled by recurrent neural networks. The encoder reads the source sequence into a list of continuousspace representations from which the decoder generates the target sequence. An attention mechanism ( <ref type="bibr">Bahdanau et al., 2015)</ref> is often used to locate the region of focus during decoding.</p><p>Extractive systems create a summary by identifying (and subsequently concatenating) the most important sentences in a document. A few recent approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cheng and Lapata, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nalla- pati et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Narayan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Yasunaga et al., 2017)</ref> conceptualize extractive summarization as a sequence labeling task in which each label specifies whether each document sentence should be included in the summary. Existing models rely on recurrent neural networks to derive a meaning representation of the document which is then used to label each sentence, taking the previously labeled sentences into account. These models are typically trained using cross-entropy loss in order to maximize the likelihood of the ground-truth labels and do not necessarily learn to rank sentences based on their importance due to the absence of a ranking-based objective. Another discrepancy comes from the mismatch between the learning objective and the evaluation criterion, namely ROUGE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lin and Hovy, 2003)</ref>, which takes the entire summary into account.</p><p>In this paper we argue that cross-entropy training is not optimal for extractive summarization. Models trained this way are prone to generating verbose summaries with unnecessarily long sentences and redundant information. We propose to overcome these difficulties by globally optimizing the ROUGE evaluation metric and learning to rank sentences for summary generation through a reinforcement learning objective. Similar to previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cheng and Lapata, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Narayan et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Nallapati et al., 2017)</ref>, our neural summarization model consists of a hierarchical docu-ment encoder and a hierarchical sentence extractor. During training, it combines the maximumlikelihood cross-entropy loss with rewards from policy gradient reinforcement learning to directly optimize the evaluation metric relevant for the summarization task. We show that this global optimization framework renders extractive models better at discriminating among sentences for the final summary; a sentence is ranked high for selection if it often occurs in high scoring summaries.</p><p>We report results on the CNN and DailyMail news highlights datasets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hermann et al., 2015)</ref> which have been recently used as testbeds for the evaluation of neural summarization systems. Experimental results show that when evaluated automatically (in terms of ROUGE), our model outperforms state-of-the-art extractive and abstractive systems. We also conduct two human evaluations in order to assess (a) which type of summary participants prefer (we compare extractive and abstractive systems) and (b) how much key information from the document is preserved in the summary (we ask participants to answer questions pertaining to the content in the document by reading system summaries). Both evaluations overwhelmingly show that human subjects find our summaries more informative and complete.</p><p>Our contributions in this work are three-fold: a novel application of reinforcement learning to sentence ranking for extractive summarization; corroborated by analysis and empirical results showing that cross-entropy training is not well-suited to the summarization task; and large scale user studies following two evaluation paradigms which demonstrate that state-of-the-art abstractive systems lag behind extractive ones when the latter are globally trained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Summarization as Sentence Ranking</head><p>Given a document D consisting of a sequence of sentences (s 1 , s 2 , ..., s n ) , an extractive summarizer aims to produce a summary S by selecting m sentences from D (where m &lt; n). For each sentence s i ∈ D, we predict a label y i ∈ {0, 1} (where 1 means that s i should be included in the summary) and assign a score p(y i |s i , D, θ) quantifying s i 's relevance to the summary. The model learns to assign p(1|s i , D, θ) &gt; p(1|s j , D, θ) when sentence s i is more relevant than s j . Model parameters are denoted by θ. We estimate p(y i |s i , D, θ) using a neural network model and assemble a summary S by selecting m sentences with top p(1|s i , D, θ) scores.</p><p>Our architecture resembles those previously proposed in the literature ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheng and Lapata, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Nallapati et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Narayan et al., 2017</ref>).</p><p>The main components include a sentence encoder, a document encoder, and a sentence extractor (see the left block of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>) which we describe in more detail below.</p><p>Sentence Encoder A core component of our model is a convolutional sentence encoder which encodes sentences into continuous representations. In recent years, CNNs have proven useful for various NLP tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Collobert et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kim, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kalchbrenner et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Zhang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kim et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheng and Lapata, 2016)</ref> because of their effectiveness in identifying salient patterns in the input ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Xu et al., 2015</ref>). In the case of summarization, CNNs can identify named-entities and events that correlate with the gold summary.</p><p>We use temporal narrow convolution by applying a kernel filter K of width h to a window of h words in sentence s to produce a new feature. This filter is applied to each possible window of words in s to produce a feature map f ∈ R k−h+1 where k is the sentence length. We then apply max-pooling over time over the feature map f and take the maximum value as the feature corresponding to this particular filter K. We use multiple kernels of various sizes and each kernel multiple times to construct the representation of a sentence. In <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, kernels of size 2 (red) and 4 (blue) are applied three times each. Max-pooling over time yields two feature lists f K 2 and f K 4 ∈ R 3 . The final sentence embeddings have six dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Document Encoder</head><p>The document encoder composes a sequence of sentences to obtain a document representation. We use a recurrent neural network with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells to avoid the vanishing gradient problem when training long sequences <ref type="bibr">(Hochreiter and Schmid- huber, 1997</ref>). Given a document D consisting of a sequence of sentences (s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s n ), we follow common practice and feed sentences in reverse order ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Li et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Filip- pova et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Narayan et al., 2017)</ref>. This way we make sure that the network also considers the top sentences of the document which are particularly important for summarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Rush et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Nallapati et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Sentence Extractor Our sentence extractor sequentially labels each sentence in a document with 1 (relevant for the summary) or 0 (otherwise).  y 5 y 4 y 3 y 2 y 1 <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Extractive summarization model with reinforcement learning: a hierarchical encoder-decoder model ranks sentences for their extract-worthiness and a candidate summary is assembled from the top ranked sentences; the REWARD generator compares the candidate against the gold summary to give a reward which is used in the REINFORCE algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Williams, 1992</ref>) to update the model.</p><p>It is implemented with another RNN with LSTM cells and a softmax layer. At time t i , it reads sentence s i and makes a binary prediction, conditioned on the document representation (obtained from the document encoder) and the previously labeled sentences. This way, the sentence extractor is able to identify locally and globally important sentences within the document. We rank the sentences in a document D by p(y i = 1|s i , D, θ), the confidence scores assigned by the softmax layer of the sentence extractor. We learn to rank sentences by training our network in a reinforcement learning framework, directly optimizing the final evaluation metric, namely ROUGE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lin and Hovy, 2003)</ref>. Before we describe our training algorithm, we elaborate on why the maximum-likelihood cross-entropy objective could be deficient for ranking sentences for summarization (Section 3). Then, we define our reinforcement learning objective in Section 4 and show that our new way of training allows the model to better discriminate amongst sentences, i.e., a sentence is ranked higher for selection if it often occurs in high scoring summaries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The Pitfalls of Cross-Entropy Loss</head><p>Previous work optimizes summarization models by maximizing p(y|D, θ) = ∏ n i=1 p(y i |s i , D, θ), the likelihood of the ground-truth labels y = (y 1 , y 2 , ..., y n ) for sentences (s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s n ), given document D and model parameters θ. This objective can be achieved by minimizing the cross-entropy loss at each decoding step:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L(θ) = − n ∑ i=1 log p(y i |s i , D, θ).<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Cross-entropy training leads to two kinds of discrepancies in the model. The first discrepancy comes from the disconnect between the task definition and the training objective. While MLE in Equation (1) aims to maximize the likelihood of the ground-truth labels, the model is (a) expected to rank sentences to generate a summary and (b) evaluated using ROUGE at test time. The second discrepancy comes from the reliance on ground-truth labels. Document collections for training summarization systems do not naturally contain labels indicating which sentences should be extracted. Instead, they are typically accompanied by abstractive summaries from which sentence-level labels are extrapolated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheng and Lapata (2016)</ref> follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Woodsend and Lapata (2010)</ref> in adopting a rule-based method which assigns labels to each sentence in the document individually based on their semantic correspondence with the gold summary (see the fourth column in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>). An alternative method ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Svore et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cao et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Nallapati et al., 2017</ref>) identifies the set of sentences which collectively gives the highest ROUGE with respect to the gold summary. Sentences in this set are labeled with 1 and 0 otherwise (see the column 5 in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>Labeling sentences individually often generates too many positive labels causing the model to  overfit the data. For example, the document in Table 1 has 12 positively labeled sentences out of 31 in total (only first 10 are shown). Collective labels present a better alternative since they only pertain to the few sentences deemed most suitable to form the summary. However, a model trained with cross-entropy loss on collective labels will underfit the data as it will only maximize probabilities p(1|s i , D, θ) for sentences in this set (e.g., sentences {0, 11, 13} in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) and ignore all other sentences. We found that there are many candidate summaries with high ROUGE scores which could be considered during training. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> (last column) shows candidate summaries ranked according to the mean of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L F 1 scores. Interestingly, multiple top ranked summaries have reasonably high ROUGE scores. For example, the average ROUGE for the summaries ranked second (0,13), third <ref type="bibr">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr">13)</ref>, and fourth (0,1,13) is 57.5%, 57.2%, and 57.1%, and all top 16 summaries have ROUGE scores more or equal to 50%. A few sentences are indicative of important content and appear frequently in the summaries: sentence 13 occurs in all summaries except one, while sentence 0 appears in several summaries too. Also note that summaries <ref type="bibr">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr">13)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr">13)</ref> yield better ROUGE scores compared to longer summaries, and may be as informative, yet more concise, alternatives.</p><p>These discrepancies render the model less efficient at ranking sentences for the summarization task. Instead of maximizing the likelihood of the ground-truth labels, we could train the model to predict the individual ROUGE score for each sentence in the document and then select the top m sentences with highest scores. But sentences with individual ROUGE scores do not necessarily lead to a high scoring summary, e.g., they may convey overlapping content and form verbose and redundant summaries. For example, sentence 3, despite having a high individual ROUGE score (35.6%), does not occur in any of the top 5 summaries. We next explain how we address these issues using reinforcement learning.</p><p>to-sequence generation models in order to directly optimize the metric used at test time, e.g., BLEU or ROUGE ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ranzato et al., 2015)</ref>. We adapt reinforcement learning to our formulation of extractive summarization to rank sentences for summary generation. We propose an objective function that combines the maximum-likelihood cross-entropy loss with rewards from policy gradient reinforcement learning to globally optimize ROUGE. Our training algorithm allows to explore the space of possible summaries, making our model more robust to unseen data. As a result, reinforcement learning helps extractive summarization in two ways: (a) it directly optimizes the evaluation metric instead of maximizing the likelihood of the ground-truth labels and (b) it makes our model better at discriminating among sentences; a sentence is ranked high for selection if it often occurs in high scoring summaries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Policy Learning</head><p>We cast the neural summarization model introduced in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> in the Reinforcement Learning paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Sutton and Barto, 1998)</ref>. Accordingly, the model can be viewed as an "agent" which interacts with an "environment" consisting of documents. At first, the agent is initialized randomly, it reads document D and predicts a relevance score for each sentence s i ∈ D using "policy" p(y i |s i , D, θ), where θ are model parameters. Once the agent is done reading the document, a summary with labelsˆylabelsˆ labelsˆy is sampled out of the ranked sentences. The agent is then given a "reward" r commensurate with how well the extract resembles the gold-standard summary. Specifically, as reward function we use mean F 1 of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L. Unigram and bigram overlap (ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2) are meant to assess informativeness, whereas the longest common subsequence (ROUGE-L) is meant to assess fluency. We update the agent using the REIN-FORCE algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Williams, 1992</ref>) which aims to minimize the negative expected reward:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L(θ) = −E ˆ y∼ p θ [r( ˆ y)]<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where, p θ stands for p(y|D, θ). REINFORCE is based on the observation that the expected gradient of a non-differentiable reward function (ROUGE, in our case) can be computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">∇L(θ) = −E ˆ y∼ p θ [r( ˆ y)∇ log p( ˆ y|D, θ)]<label>(3)</label></formula><p>While MLE in Equation (1) aims to maximize the likelihood of the training data, the objective in Equation (2) learns to discriminate among sentences with respect to how often they occur in high scoring summaries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Training with High Probability Samples</head><p>Computing the expectation term in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_2">(3)</ref> is prohibitive, since there is a large number of possible extracts. In practice, we approximate the expected gradient using a single samplê y from p θ for each training example in a batch:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">∇L(θ) ≈ −r( ˆ y)∇ log p( ˆ y|D, θ) ≈ −r( ˆ y) n ∑ i=1 ∇ log p( ˆ y i |s i , D, θ)<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Presented in its original form, the REINFORCE algorithm starts learning with a random policy which can make model training challenging for complex tasks like ours where a single document can give rise to a very large number of candidate summaries. We therefore limit the search space ofˆyofˆ ofˆy in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">(4)</ref> to the set of largest probability samplesˆYsamplesˆ samplesˆY. We approximatê Y by the k extracts which receive highest ROUGE scores. More concretely, we assemble candidate summaries efficiently by first selecting p sentences from the document which on their own have high ROUGE scores. We then generate all possible combinations of p sentences subject to maximum length m and evaluate them against the gold summary. Summaries are ranked according to F 1 by taking the mean of ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L. ˆ Y contains these top k candidate summaries. During training, we samplê y fromˆYfromˆ fromˆY instead of p( ˆ y|D, θ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ranzato et al. (2015)</ref> proposed an alternative to REINFORCE called MIXER (Mixed Incremental Cross-Entropy Reinforce) which first pretrains the model with the cross-entropy loss using ground truth labels and then follows a curriculum learning strategy ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Bengio et al., 2015)</ref> to gradually teach the model to produce stable predictions on its own. In our experiments MIXER performed worse than the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Nallapati et al. (2017)</ref> just trained on collective labels. We conjecture that this is due to the unbounded nature of our ranking problem. Recall that our model assigns relevance scores to sentences rather than words. The space of sentential representations is vast and fairly unconstrained compared to other prediction tasks operating with fixed vocabularies ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Paulus et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Zhang and Lapata, 2017)</ref>. Moreover, our approximation of the gradient allows the model to converge much faster to an optimal policy. Advantageously, we do not require an online reward estimator, we pre-computê Y, which leads to a significant speedup during training compared to MIXER <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Ranzato et al., 2015</ref>) and related training schemes <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Shen et al., 2016</ref>).</p></div>

We describe our datasets, discuss implementation details, our evaluation protocol, and the systems used for comparison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summarization Datasets</head><p>We evaluated our models on the CNN and DailyMail news highlights datasets ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hermann et al., 2015)</ref>. We used the standard splits of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hermann et al. (2015)</ref> for training, validation, and testing (90,266/1,220/1,093 documents for CNN and 196,961/12,148/10,397 for DailyMail). We did not anonymize entities or lower case tokens.

During training we use these to generate high scoring extracts and to estimate rewards for them, but during testing, they are used as reference summaries to evaluate our models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implementation Details</head><p>We generated extracts by selecting three sentences (m = 3) for CNN articles and four sentences (m = 4) for DailyMail articles. These decisions were informed by the fact that gold highlights in the CNN/DailyMail validation sets are 2.6/4.2 sentences long. For both datasets, we estimated high-scoring extracts using 10 document sentences (p = 10) with highest ROUGE scores. We tuned the initialization parameter k forˆYforˆ forˆY on the validation set: we found that our model performs best with k = 5 for the CNN dataset and k = 15 for the DailyMail dataset.</p><p>We used the One Billion Word Benchmark corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chelba et al., 2013</ref>) to train word embeddings with the skip-gram model ( ) using context window size 6, negative sampling size 10, and hierarchical softmax 1.

We report unigram and bigram overlap (ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2) as a means of assessing informativeness and the longest common subsequence (ROUGE-L) as a means of assessing fluency. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We compared REFRESH against a baseline which simply selects the first m leading sentences from each document (LEAD) and two neural models similar to ours (see left block in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>), both trained with cross-entropy loss. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheng and Lapata (2016)</ref> train on individual labels, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Nallapati et al. (2017)</ref> use collective labels. We also compared our model against the abstractive systems of , <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Nallapati et al. (2016)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">See et al. (2017)</ref>, and Tan and <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Wan (2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> In addition to ROUGE which can be misleading when used as the only means to assess the informativeness of summaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Schluter, 2017)</ref>, we also evaluated system output by eliciting human judgments in two ways. In our first experiment, participants were presented with a news article and summaries generated by three systems: the LEAD baseline, abstracts from <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">See et al. (2017)</ref>, and extracts from REFRESH. We also included the human-authored highlights. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Participants read the articles and were asked to rank the summaries from best (1) to worst (4) in order of informativeness (does the summary capture important information in the article?) and fluency (is the summary written in well-formed English?). We did not allow any ties. We randomly selected 10 articles from the CNN test set and 10 from the DailyMail test set. The study was completed by five participants, all native or proficient English speakers. Each participant was presented with the 20 articles. The order of summaries to rank was randomized per article and the order of articles per participant. Examples of summaries our subjects ranked are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>Our second experiment assessed the degree to which our model retains key information from the document following a question-answering (QA) paradigm which has been previously used to evaluate summary quality and text compression (Mor-2 We used pyrouge, a Python package, to compute all ROUGE scores with parameters "-a -c 95 -m -n 4 -w 1.2."</p><p>3 Cheng and Lapata (2016) report ROUGE recall scores on the DailyMail dataset only. We used their code (https:// github.com/cheng6076/NeuralSum) to produce ROUGE F 1 scores on both CNN and DailyMail datasets. For other systems, all results are taken from their papers. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We are grateful to Abigail See for providing us with the output of her system. We did not include output from <ref type="bibr">Nallap- ati et al. (2017)</ref>, , <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Nallapati et al. (2016)</ref>, or Tan and Wan (2017) in our human evaluation study, as these models are trained on a named-entity anonymized version of the CNN and DailyMail datasets, and as result produce summaries which are not comparable to ours. We did not include extracts from Cheng and Lapata (2016) either as they were significantly inferior to LEAD (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>). <ref type="bibr">ris et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mani et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Clarke and La- pata, 2010</ref>). We created a set of questions based on the gold summary under the assumption that it highlights the most important document content. We then examined whether participants were able to answer these questions by reading system summaries alone without access to the article. The more questions a system can answer, the better it is at summarizing the document as a whole.</p><p>We worked on the same 20 documents used in our first elicitation study. We wrote multiple factbased question-answer pairs for each gold summary without looking at the document. Questions were formulated so as to not reveal answers to subsequent questions. We created 71 questions in total varying from two to six questions per gold summary. Example questions are given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>. Participants read the summary and answered all associated questions as best they could without access to the original document or the gold summary. Subjects were shown summaries from three systems: the LEAD baseline, the abstractive system of <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">See et al. (2017)</ref>, and REFRESH. Five participants answered questions for each summary. We used the same scoring mechanism from Clarke and Lapata (2010), i.e., a correct answer was marked with a score of one, partially correct answers with a score of 0.5, and zero otherwise. The final score for a system is the average of all its question scores. Answers were elicited using Amazon's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform. We uploaded data in batches (one system at a time) on Mechanical Turk to ensure that same participant does not evaluate summaries from different systems on the same set of questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Results</head><p>We report results using automatic metrics in Table 2. The top part of the table compares RE-FRESH against related extractive systems. The bottom part reports the performance of abstractive systems.

(2017)</ref> as they generate anonymized summaries.</p><p>Their system lags behind their LEAD baseline on ROUGE-L on the CNN+DailyMail dataset (35.5% vs 35.3%). Also note that their model is trained on collective labels and has a significant lead over <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheng and Lapata (2016)</ref>. As discussed in Section 3 cross-entropy training on individual labels tends to overgenerate positive labels leading to less informative and verbose summaries.</p><p>Extractive vs Abstractive Systems Our automatic evaluation results further demonstrate that REFRESH is superior to abstractive systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Nallapati et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">See et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Tan and Wan, 2017</ref>) which are all variants of an encoder-decoder architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Sutskever et al., 2014</ref>). Despite being more faithful to the actual summarization task (hand-written summaries combine several pieces of information from the original document), abstractive systems lag behind the LEAD baseline. Tan and Wan (2017) present a graph-based neural model, which manages to outperform LEAD on ROUGE-1 but falters when higher order ROUGE scores are used. Amongst abstractive systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">See et al. (2017)</ref> perform best. Interestingly, their system is mostly extractive, exhibiting a small degree of rewriting; it copies more than 35% of the sentences in the source document, 85% of 4-grams, 90% of 3-grams, 95% of bigrams, and 99% of unigrams.</p><p>Human Evaluation: System <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Ranking Table 3</ref> shows, proportionally, how often participants ranked each system, 1st, 2nd, and so on. Perhaps unsurprisingly human-authored summaries are considered best (and ranked 1st 39% of the  time). REFRESH is ranked 2nd best followed by <ref type="bibr">LEAD and See et al. (2017)</ref> which are mostly ranked in 3rd and 4th places. We carried out pairwise comparisons between all models in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref> to assess whether system differences are statistically significant. There is no significant difference between <ref type="bibr">LEAD and See et al. (2017)</ref>, and REFRESH and GOLD (using a one-way ANOVA with posthoc Tukey HSD tests; p &lt; 0.01). All other differences are statistically significant.</p></div>

QAbased evaluation is more focused and a closer reflection of users' information need (i.e., to find out what the article is about), whereas ROUGE simply captures surface similarity (i.e., n-gram overlap) between output summaries and their references. Interestingly, LEAD is considered better than <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">See et al. (2017)</ref> in the QA evaluation, whereas we find the opposite when participants are asked to rank systems. We hypothesize that LEAD is indeed more informative than <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">See et al. (2017)</ref> but humans prefer shorter summaries. The average length of LEAD summaries is 105.7 words compared to 61.6 for <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">See et al. (2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Related Work</head><p>Traditional summarization methods manually define features to rank sentences for their salience in order to identify the most important sentences in a document or set of documents ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kupiec et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mani, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Nenkova et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Spärck Jones, 2007)</ref>. A vast majority of these methods learn to score each sentence independently ( <ref type="bibr">Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Teufel and Moens, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Erkan and Radev, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Shen et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Schilder and Kondadadi, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Wan, 2010)</ref> and a summary is generated by selecting top-scored sentences in a way that is not incorporated into the learning process. Summary quality can be improved heuristically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Yih et al., 2007)</ref>, via max-margin methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Li et al., 2009)</ref>, or integer-linear programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Woodsend and Lapata, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Woodsend and Lapata, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Almeida and Mar- tins, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Parveen et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Recent deep learning methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kågebäck et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Yin and Pei, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cheng and Lapata, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Nallapati et al., 2017</ref>) learn continuous features without any linguistic preprocessing (e.g., named entities). Like traditional methods, these approaches also suffer from the mismatch between the learning objective and the evaluation criterion (e.g., ROUGE) used at the test time. In comparison, our neural model globally optimizes the ROUGE evaluation metric through a reinforcement learning objective: sentences are highly ranked if they occur in highly scoring summaries.</p><p>Reinforcement learning has been previously used in the context of traditional multi-document summarization as a means of selecting a sentence or a subset of sentences from a document cluster. Ryang and Abekawa (2012) cast the sentence selection task as a search problem. Their agent observes a state (e.g., a candidate summary), executes an action (a transition operation that produces a new state selecting a not-yet-selected sentence), and then receives a delayed reward based on tf * idf. Follow-on work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Rioux et al., 2014)</ref> extends this approach by employing ROUGE as part of the reward function, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Henß et al. (2015)</ref> further experiment with Q-learning. <ref type="bibr">Mollá- Aliod (2017)</ref> has adapt this approach to queryfocused summarization. Our model differs from these approaches both in application and formulation. We focus solely on extractive summarization, in our case states are documents (not summaries) and actions are relevance scores which lead to sentence ranking (not sentence-to-sentence transitions). Rather than employing reinforcement learning for sentence selection, our algorithm performs sentence ranking using ROUGE as the reward function.</p><p>The REINFORCE algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Williams, 1992</ref>) has been shown to improve encoder-decoder textrewriting systems by allowing to directly optimize a non-differentiable objective ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Ranzato et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Paulus et al., 2017</ref>) or to inject task-specific constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Zhang and Lapata, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Nogueira and Cho, 2017)</ref>. However, we are not aware of any attempts to use reinforcement learning for training a sentence ranker in the context of extractive summarization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusions</head><p>In this work we developed an extractive summarization model which is globally trained by optimizing the ROUGE evaluation metric. Our training algorithm explores the space of candidate summaries while learning to optimize a reward function which is relevant for the task at hand. Experimental results show that reinforcement learning offers a great means to steer our model towards generating informative, fluent, and concise summaries outperforming state-of-the-art extractive and abstractive systems on the CNN and DailyMail datasets. In the future we would like to focus on smaller discourse units <ref type="bibr">(Mann and Thomp- son, 1988</ref>) rather than individual sentences, modeling compression and extraction jointly.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Candidate</head><label></label><figDesc></figDesc></figure>
