			<abstract>
				<p>We report improved AMR parsing results by adding a new action to a transition-based AMR parser to infer abstract concepts and by incorporating richer features produced by auxiliary analyzers such as a semantic role labeler and a coreference resolver. We report final AMR parsing results that show an improvement of 7% absolute in F 1 score over the best previously reported result. Our parser is available at: https://github.com/ Juicechuan/AMRParsing</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>AMR parsing is the task of taking a sentence as input and producing as output an Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) that is a rooted, directed, edge-labeled and leaf-labeled graph that is used to represent the meaning of a sentence <ref type="bibr">(Ba- narescu et al., 2013)</ref>. AMR parsing has drawn an increasing amount of attention recently. The first published AMR parser, JAMR <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Flanigan et al., 2014</ref>), performs AMR parsing in two stages: concept identification and relation identification. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Flanigan et al. (2014)</ref> treat concept identification as a sequence labeling task and utilize a semiMarkov model to map spans of words in a sentence to concept graph fragments. For relation identification, they adopt graph-based techniques similar to those used in dependency parsing <ref type="bibr">(Mc- Donald et al., 2005</ref>). Instead of finding maximum spanning trees (MST) over words, they propose an algorithm that finds the maximum spanning connected subgraph (MSCG) over concept fragments identified in the first stage.</p><p>A competitive alternative to the MSCG approach is transition-based AMR parsing. Our previous work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wang et al., 2015</ref>) describes a transition-based system that also involves two stages. In the first step, an input sentence is parsed into a dependency tree with a dependency parser. In the second step, the transition-based AMR parser transforms the dependency tree into an AMR graph by performing a series of actions. Note that the dependency parser used in the first step can be any off-the-shelf dependency parser and does not have to trained on the same data set as used in the second step. Unlike a dependency parse where each leaf node corresponds to a word in a sentence and there is an inherent alignment between the words in a sentence and the leaf nodes in the parse tree, the alignment between the word tokens in a sentence and the concepts in an AMR graph is non-trivial. Both JAMR and our transition-based parser rely on a heuristics based aligner that can align the words in a sentence and concepts in its AMR with a 90% F 1 score, but there are some concepts in the AMR that cannot be aligned to any word in a sentence. This is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> where the concept have-org-role-91 is not aligned to any word or word sequence. We refer to these concepts as abstract concepts, and existing AMR parsers do not have a systematic way of inferring such abstract concepts.</p><p>Current AMR parsers are in their early stages of development, and their features are not yet fully developed. For example, the AMR makes heavy use of the framesets and semantic role labels used in the Proposition Bank ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Palmer et al., 2005</ref>), and it would seem that information produced by a semantic role labeling system trained on the PropBank can be used as features to improve the AMR parsing accuracy. Similarly, since AMR represents limited within-sentence coreference, coreference information produced by an off-the-shelf coreference system should benefit the AMR parser as well.</p><p>In this paper, we describe an extension to our transition-based AMR parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wang et al., 2015)</ref> by adding a new action to infer the abstract concepts in an AMR, and new features derived from an off-the-shelf semantic role labeling system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Pradhan et al., 2004</ref>) and coreference system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lee et al., 2013</ref>). We also experimented with adding Brown clusters as features to the AMR parser. Additionally, we experimented with using different syntactic parsers in the first stage. Following our previous work, we use the averaged perceptron algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Collins, 2002</ref>) to train the parameters of the model and use the greedy parsing strategy during decoding to determine the best action sequence to apply for each training instance. Our results show that (i) the transitionbased AMR parser is very stable across the different parsers used in the first stage, (ii) adding the new action significantly improves the parser performance, and (iii) semantic role information is beneficial to AMR parsing when used as features, while the Brown clusters do not make a difference and coreference information slightly hurts the AMR parsing performance.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we briefly describe the transition-based parser, and in Section 3 we describe our extensions. We report experimental results in Section 4 and conclude the paper in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Transition-based AMR Parser</head><p>The transition-based parser first uses a dependency parser to parse an input sentence, and then performs a limited number of highly general actions to transform the dependency tree to an AMR graph. The transition actions are briefly described below but due to the limited space, we cannot describe the full details of these actions, and the reader is referred to our previous work ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wang et al., 2015)</ref> for detailed descriptions of these actions:</p><p>• NEXT-EDGE-l r (ned): Assign the current edge with edge label l r and go to next edge.</p><p>• SWAP-l r (sw): Swap the current edge, make the current dependent as the new head, and assign edge label l r to the swapped edge.</p><p>• REATTACH k -l r (reat): Reattach current dependent to node k and assign edge label l r .</p><p>• REPLACE-HEAD (rph): Replace current head node with current dependent node.</p><p>• REENTRANCE k -l r (reen): Add another head node k to current dependent and assign label l r to edge between k and current dependent.</p><p>• MERGE (mrg): Merge two nodes connected by the edge into one node.</p><p>From each node in the dependency tree, the parser performs the following 2 actions:</p><p>• NEXT-NODE-l c (nnd): Assign the current node with concept label l c and go to next node.</p><p>• DELETE-NODE (dnd): Delete the current node and all edges associated with current node.</p><p>Crucially, none of these actions can infer the types of abstract concepts illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. And this serves as our baseline parser. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Parser Extensions</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Inferring Abstract Concepts</head><p>We previously create the learning target by representing an AMR graph as a Span Graph, where each AMR concept is annotated with the text span of the word or the (contiguous) word sequence it is aligned to. However, abstract concepts that are not aligned to any word or word sequence are simply ignored and are unreachable during training. To address this, we construct the span graph by keeping the abstract concepts as they are in the AMR graph, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. In order to predict these abstract concepts, we design an INFER-l c action that is applied in the following way: when the parser visits an node in dependency tree, it inserts an abstract node with concept label l c right between the current node and its parent. For example in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, after applying action INFER-have-org-role-91 on node minister, the abstract concept is recovered and subsequent actions can be applied to transform the subgraph to its correct AMR. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Feature Enrichment</head><p>In our previous work, we only use simple lexical features and structural features. We extend the feature set to include (i) features generated by a semantic role labeling system-ASSERT <ref type="bibr">(Prad- han et al., 2004</ref>), including a frameset disambiguator trained using a word sense disambiguation system-IMS (Zhong and Ng, 2010) and a coreference system ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lee et al., 2013</ref>) and (ii) features generated using semi-supervised word clusters ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Turian et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Koo et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Coreference features Coreference is typically represented as a chain of mentions realized as noun phrases or pronouns. AMR, on the other hand, represents coreference as re-entrance and uses one concept to represent all co-referring entities. To use the coreference information to inform AMR parsing actions, we design the following two features: 1) SHARE DEPENDENT. When applying REENTRANCE k -l r action on edge (a, b), we check whether the corresponding head node k of a candidate concept has any dependent node that co-refers with current dependent b. 2) DEPENDENT LABEL. If SHARE DEPENDENT is true for head node k and assuming k's dependent m co-refers with the current dependent, the value of this feature is set to the dependency label between k and m. For example, for the partial graph shown in <ref type="figure">Fig- ure 4</ref>, when examining edge (wants, boy), we may consider REENTRANCE believe -ARG1 as one of the candidate actions. The candidate head believe has dependent him which is co-referred with current dependent boy, therefore the value of feature SHARE DEPENDENT is set to true for this candidate action. Also the value of feature DE-PENDENT LABEL is dobj given the dependency label between (believe, him). Semantic role labeling features We use the following semantic role labeling features: 1) EQ FRAMESET. For action that predicts the concept label (NEXT-NODE-l c ), we check whether the candidate concept label l c matches the frameset predicted by the semantic role labeler. For example, for partial graph in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, when we examine node wants, one of the candidate actions would be NEXT-NODE-want-01. Since the candidate concept label want-01 is equal to node wants's frameset want-01 as predicted by the semantic role labeler, the value of feature EQ FRAMESET is set to true. 2) IS ARGUMENT. For actions that predicts the edge label, we check whether the semantic role labeler predicts that the current dependent is an argument of the current head. Note that the arguments in semantic role labeler output are non-terminals which corresponds to a sentence span. Here we simply take the head word in the sentence span as the argument.</p><p>Word Clusters For the semi-supervised word cluster feature, we use Brown clusters, more specifically, 1000 classes word cluster trained by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Turian et al. (2010)</ref>. We use prefixes of lengths 4,6,10,20 of the word's bit-string as features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>We first tune and evaluate our system on the newswire section of LDC2013E117 dataset. Then we show our parser's performance on the recent LDC2014T12 dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experiments on LDC2013E117</head><p>We first conduct our experiments on the newswire section of AMR annotation corpus (LDC2013E117). The train/dev/test split of dataset is 4.0K/2.1K/2.1K, which is identical to the settings of JAMR. We evaluate our parser with Smatch v2.0    <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: AMR parsing performance on the development set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Impact of different syntactic parsers</head><p>We experimented with four different parsers: the Stanford parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Manning et al., 2014</ref>), the Charniak parser <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Charniak and Johnson, 2005</ref>) (Its phrase structure output is converted to dependency structure using the Stanford CoreNLP converter), the Malt Parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Nivre et al., 2006</ref>), and the Turbo Parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Martins et al., 2013</ref>). All the parsers we used are trained on the 02-22 sections of the Penn Treebank, except for CHARNIAK(ON), which is trained on the OntoNotes corpus ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hovy et al., 2006</ref>) on the training and development partitions used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Pradhan et al. (2013)</ref> after excluding a few documents that overlapped with the AMR corpus 1 . All the different dependency trees are then used as input to our baseline system and we evaluate AMR parsing performance on the development set.</p><p>From <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, we can see that the performance of the baseline transition-based system remains very stable when different dependency parsers used are trained on same data set. However, the Charniak parser that is trained on a much larger and more diverse dataset (CHARNIAK (ON)) yields the best overall AMR parsing performance. Subsequent experiments are all based on this version of the Charniak parser.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Impact of parser extensions</head><p>In <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> we present results from extending the transition-based AMR parser. All experiments are conducted on the development set. From <ref type="table">Table  2</ref>, we can see that the INFER action yields a 4 point improvement in F 1 score over the CHAR-NIAK(ON) system. Adding Brown clusters improves the recall by 1 point, but the F 1 score remains unchanged. Adding semantic role features on top of the Brown clusters leads to an improvement of another 2 points in F 1 score, and gives us the best result. Adding coreference features actually slightly hurts the performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">Final Result on Test Set</head><p>We evaluate the best model we get from §4.1 on the test set, as shown in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. For comparison purposes, we also include results of all published parsers on the same dataset: the updated version of JAMR, the old version of JAMR ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Flanigan et al., 2014</ref>), the Stanford AMR parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Werling et al., 2015)</ref>, the SHRG-based AMR parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Peng et al., 2015)</ref> and our baseline parser ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wang et al., 2015)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Experiments on LDC2014T12</head><p>In this section, we conduct experiments on the AMR annotation release 1.0 (LDC2014T12), which contains 13,051 AMRs from newswire, weblogs and web discussion forums. We use the training/development/test split recommended in the release: 10,312 sentences for training, 1,368 sentences for development and 1,371 sentences for testing. We re-train the parser on the LDC2014T12 training set with the best parser configuration given in §4.1, and test the parser on the test set. The result is shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>. For comparison purposes, we also include the results of the updated version of JAMR and our baseline parser in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wang et al., 2015</ref>) which are also trained on the same dataset. There is a significant drop-off in performance compared with the results on the LDC2013E117 test set for all the parsers, but our parser outperforms the other parsers by a similar margin on both test sets.</p></div>
