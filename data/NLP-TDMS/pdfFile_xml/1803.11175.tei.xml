				<p>We present models for encoding sentences into embedding vectors that specifically target transfer learning to other NLP tasks. The models are efficient and result in accurate performance on diverse transfer tasks. Two variants of the encoding models allow for trade-offs between accuracy and compute resources. For both variants , we investigate and report the relationship between model complexity, resource consumption, the availability of transfer task training data, and task performance. Comparisons are made with base-lines that use word level transfer learning via pretrained word embeddings as well as baselines do not use any transfer learning. We find that transfer learning using sentence embeddings tends to outperform word level transfer. With transfer learning via sentence embeddings, we observe surprisingly good performance with minimal amounts of supervised training data for a transfer task. We obtain encouraging results on Word Embedding Association Tests (WEAT) targeted at detecting model bias. Our pre-trained sentence encoding models are made freely available for download and on TF Hub.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Limited amounts of training data are available for many NLP tasks. This presents a challenge for data hungry deep learning methods. Given the high cost of annotating supervised training data, very large training sets are usually not available for most research or industry NLP tasks. Many models address the problem by implicitly performing limited transfer learning through the use <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Sentence similarity scores using embeddings from the universal sentence encoder.</p><p>of pre-trained word embeddings such as those produced by <ref type="bibr">word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>) or GloVe ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Pennington et al., 2014</ref>). However, recent work has demonstrated strong transfer task performance using pre-trained sentence level embeddings ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Conneau et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we present two models for producing sentence embeddings that demonstrate good transfer to a number of other of other NLP tasks. We include experiments with varying amounts of transfer task training data to illustrate the relationship between transfer task performance and training set size. We find that our sentence embeddings can be used to obtain surprisingly good task performance with remarkably little task specific training data. The sentence encoding models are made publicly available on TF Hub.</p><p>Engineering characteristics of models used for transfer learning are an important consideration. We discuss modeling trade-offs regarding memory requirements as well as compute time on CPU and GPU. Resource consumption comparisons are made for sentences of varying lengths.</p><p>import tensorflow_hub as hub embed = hub.Module("https://tfhub.dev/google/" "universal-sentence-encoder/1") embedding = embed([ "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."])</p><p>Listing 1: Python example code for using the universal sentence encoder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Model Toolkit</head><p>We The models take as input English strings and produce as output a fixed dimensional embedding representation of the string. Listing 1 provides a minimal code snippet to convert a sentence into a tensor containing its sentence embedding. The embedding tensor can be used directly or incorporated into larger model graphs for specific tasks. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> As illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, the sentence embeddings can be trivially used to compute sentence level semantic similarity scores that achieve excellent performance on the semantic textual similarity (STS) <ref type="bibr">Benchmark (Cer et al., 2017)</ref>. When included within larger models, the sentence encoding models can be fine tuned for specific tasks using gradient based updates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Encoders</head><p>We introduce the model architecture for our two encoding models in this section. Our two encoders have different design goals. One based on the transformer architecture targets high accuracy at the cost of greater model complexity and resource consumption. The other targets efficient inference with slightly reduced accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Transformer</head><p>The transformer based sentence encoding model constructs sentence embeddings using the encoding sub-graph of the transformer architecture ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Vaswani et al., 2017)</ref>. This sub-graph uses attention to compute context aware representations of words in a sentence that take into account both the ordering and identity of all the other words. The context aware word representations are converted to a fixed length sentence encoding vector by computing the element-wise sum of the representations at each word position. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The encoder takes as input a lowercased PTB tokenized string and outputs a 512 dimensional vector as the sentence embedding.</p><p>The encoding model is designed to be as general purpose as possible. This is accomplished by using multi-task learning whereby a single encoding model is used to feed multiple downstream tasks. The supported tasks include: a SkipThought like task ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kiros et al., 2015</ref>) for the unsupervised learning from arbitrary running text; a conversational input-response task for the inclusion of parsed conversational data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Henderson et al., 2017)</ref>; and classification tasks for training on supervised data. The Skip-Thought task replaces the LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) used in the original formulation with a model based on the Transformer architecture.</p><p>As will be shown in the experimental results below, the transformer based encoder achieves the best overall transfer task performance. However, this comes at the cost of compute time and memory usage scaling dramatically with sentence length.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Deep Averaging Network (DAN)</head><p>The second encoding model makes use of a deep averaging network (DAN) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Iyyer et al., 2015</ref>) whereby input embeddings for words and bi-grams are first averaged together and then passed through a feedforward deep neural network (DNN) to produce sentence embeddings. Similar to the Transformer encoder, the DAN encoder takes as input a lowercased PTB tokenized string and outputs a 512 dimensional sentence embedding. The DAN encoder is trained similarly to the Transformer based encoder. We make use of mul-titask learning whereby a single DAN encoder is used to supply sentence embeddings for multiple downstream tasks.</p><p>The primary advantage of the DAN encoder is that compute time is linear in the length of the input sequence. Similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Iyyer et al. (2015)</ref>, our results demonstrate that DANs achieve strong baseline performance on text classification tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Encoder Training Data</head><p>Unsupervised training data for the sentence encoding models are drawn from a variety of web sources. The sources are Wikipedia, web news, web question-answer pages and discussion forums. We augment unsupervised learning with training on supervised data from the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bowman et al., 2015)</ref>. Similar to the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Conneau et al. (2017)</ref>, we observe that training to SNLI improves transfer performance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Transfer Learning Models</head><p>For sentence classification transfer tasks, the output of the transformer and DAN sentence encoders are provided to a task specific DNN. For the pairwise semantic similarity task, we directly assess the similarity of the sentence embeddings produced by our two encoders. As shown Eq. 1, we first compute the cosine similarity of the two sentence embeddings and then use arccos to convert the cosine similarity into an angular distance. 5</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">sim(u, v) = 1 − arccos u · v ||u|| ||v|| /π</formula><p>(1)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Baselines</head><p>For each transfer task, we include baselines that only make use of word level transfer and baselines that make use of no transfer learning at all. For word level transfer, we use word embeddings from a word2vec skip-gram model trained on a corpus of news data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mikolov et al., 2013</ref>). The pretrained word embeddings are included as input to two model types: a convolutional neural network models (CNN) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Kim, 2014)</ref>; a DAN. The baselines that use pretrained word embeddings allow us to contrast word versus sentence level transfer. Additional baseline CNN and DAN models are trained without using any pretrained word or sentence embeddings.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experiments</head><p>Transfer task model hyperparamaters are tuned using a combination of Vizier (Golovin et al.) and light manual tuning. When available, model hyperparameters are tuned using task dev sets. Otherwise, hyperparameters are tuned by crossvalidation on the task training data when available or the evaluation test data when neither training nor dev data are provided. Training repeats ten times for each transfer task model with different randomly initialized weights and we report evaluation results by averaging across runs. Transfer learning is critically important when training data for a target task is limited. We explore the impact on task performance of varying the amount of training data available for the task both with and without the use of transfer learning. Contrasting the transformer and DAN based encoders, we demonstrate trade-offs in model complexity and the amount of data required to reach a desired level of accuracy on a task.</p><p>To assess bias in our encoding models, we evaluate the strength of various associations learned by our model on WEAT word lists. We compare our result to those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Caliskan et al. (2017)</ref> who discovered that word embeddings could be used to reproduce human performance on implicit association tasks for both benign and potentially undesirable associations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Results</head><p>Transfer task performance is summarized in Table 2. We observe that transfer learning from the transformer based sentence encoder usually performs as good or better than transfer learning from the DAN encoder. Hoewver, transfer learning using the simpler and fast DAN encoder can for some tasks perform as well or better than the more sophisticated transformer encoder. Models that make use of sentence level transfer learning tend to perform better than models that only use word level transfer. The best performance on most tasks is obtained by models that make use of both sentence and word level transfer.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref>: Task performance on SST for varying amounts of training data.

The sentence level embeddings surpass the performance of transfer learning using word level embeddings alone. Models that make use of sentence and word level transfer achieve the best overall performance. We observe that transfer learning is most helpful when limited training data is available for the transfer task. The encoding models make different trade-offs regarding accuracy and model complexity that should be considered when choosing the best model for a particular application. The pre-trained encoding models will be made publicly available for research and use in applications that can benefit from a better understanding of natural language.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2: Model Resource Usage for both USE D and USE T at different batch sizes and sentence lengths.</figDesc><graphic url="image-2.png" coords="6,74.24,72.76,127.56,127.56" type="bitmap" /></figure>

Similar to compute usage, memory usage for the 
transformer model increases quickly with sentence 
length, while the memory usage for the DAN 
model remains constant. We note that, for the 
DAN model, memory usage is dominated by the 
parameters used to store the model unigram and 
bigram embeddings. Since the transformer model 
only needs to store unigram embeddings, for short 
sequences it requires nearly half as much memory 
as the DAN model.
