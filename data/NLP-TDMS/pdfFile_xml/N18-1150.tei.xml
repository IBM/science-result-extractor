				<p>We present deep communicating agents in an encoder-decoder architecture to address the challenges of representing a long document for abstractive summariza-tion. With deep communicating agents, the task of encoding a long text is divided across multiple collaborating agents, each in charge of a subsection of the input text. These encoders are connected to a single decoder, trained end-to-end using reinforcement learning to generate a focused and coherent summary. Empirical results demonstrate that multiple communicating encoders lead to a higher quality summary compared to several strong baselines, including those based on a single encoder or multiple non-communicating encoders.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>We focus on the task of abstractive summarization of a long document. In contrast to extractive summarization, where a summary is composed of a subset of sentences or words lifted from the input text as is, abstractive summarization requires the generative ability to rephrase and restructure sentences to compose a coherent and concise summary. As recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are capable of generating fluent language, variants of encoder-decoder RNNs ( <ref type="bibr">Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al., 2015</ref>) have shown promising results on the abstractive summarization task ( <ref type="bibr">Rush et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nallapati et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The fundamental challenge, however, is that the strong performance of neural models at encoding short text does not generalize well to long text. The motivation behind our approach is to be able to dynamically attend to different parts of the input to capture salient facts. While recent work in sum- marization addresses these issues using improved attention models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chopra et al., 2016</ref>), pointer networks with coverage mechanisms ( <ref type="bibr">See et al., 2017)</ref>, and coherence-focused training objectives ( <ref type="bibr">Paulus et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jaques et al., 2017)</ref>, an effective mechanism for representing a long document remains a challenge.</p><p>Simultaneous work has investigated the use of deep communicating agents ( <ref type="bibr">Sukhbaatar et al., 2016</ref>) for collaborative tasks such as logic puzzles <ref type="bibr">(Foerster et al., 2016)</ref>, visual dialog ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Das et al., 2017)</ref>, and reference games ( <ref type="bibr">Lazaridou et al., 2016)</ref>. Our work builds on these approaches to propose the first study on using communicating agents to encode long text for summarization.</p><p>The key idea of our model is to divide the hard task of encoding a long text across multiple collaborating encoder agents, each in charge of a different subsection of the text <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>). Each of these agents encodes their assigned text independently, and broadcasts their encoding to others, allowing agents to share global context information with one another about different sections of the document. All agents then adapt the encoding of their assigned text in light of the global context and re- Figure 2: Multi-agent-encoder-decoder overview. Each agent a encodes a paragraph using a local encoder followed by multiple contextual layers with agent communication through concentrated messages z (k) a at each layer k. Communication is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. The word context vectors c t a are condensed into agent context c * t . Agent specific generation probabilities, p t a , enable voting for the suitable out-of-vocabulary words (e.g., 'yen') in the final distribution.</p><p>peat the process across multiple layers, generating new messages at each layer. Once each agent completes encoding, they deliver their information to the decoder with a novel contextual agent attention ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). Contextual agent attention enables the decoder to integrate information from multiple agents smoothly at each decoding step. The network is trained end-to-end using self-critical reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr">(Rennie et al., 2016</ref>) to generate focused and coherent summaries.</p><p>Empirical results on the CNN/DailyMail and New York Times datasets demonstrate that multiple communicating encoders lead to higher quality summaries compared to strong baselines, including those based on a single encoder or multiple non-communicating encoders. Human evaluations indicate that our model is able to produce more focused summaries. The agents gather salient information from multiple areas of the document, and communicate their information with one another, thus reducing common mistakes such as missing key facts, repeating the same content, or including unnecessary details. Further analysis reveals that our model attains better performance when the decoder interacts with multiple agents in a more balanced way, confirming the benefit of representing a long document with multiple encoding agents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Model</head><p>We extend the CommNet model of <ref type="bibr">Sukhbaatar et al. (2016)</ref> for sequence generation.</p><p>Notation Each document d is a sequence of paragraphs x a , which are split across multiple encoding agents a=1,..,M (e.g., agent-1 encodes the first paragraph x 1 , agent-2 the second paragraph x 2 , so on). Each paragraph x a ={w a,i } I , is a sequence of I words. We construct a V -sized vocabulary from the training documents from the most frequently appearing words. Each word w a,i is embedded into a n-dimensional vector e a,i . All W variables are linear projection matrices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Multi-Agent Encoder</head><p>Each agent encodes the word sequences with the following two stacked encoders. Local Encoder The first layer is a local encoder of each agent a, where the tokens of the corresponding paragraph x a are fed into a single layer bi-directional LSTM (bLSTM), producing the local encoder hidden states, h</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(1) i ∈ R H : − → h (1) i , ← − h (1) i = bLSTM(e i , − → h (1) i−1 , ← − h (1) i+1 ) (1) h (1) i = W 1 [ − → h (1) i , ← − h (1) i ] (2)</formula><p>where H is the hidden state dimensionality. The output of the local encoder layer is fed into the contextual encoder. Contextual Encoder Our framework enables agent communication cycles across multiple encoding layers. The output of each contextual encoder is an adapted representation of the agent's encoded information conditioned on the information received from the other agents. At each layer k=1,..,K, each agent a jointly encodes the information received from the previous layer (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig- ure 3)</ref>. Each cell of the (k+1)th contextual layer is a bLSTM that takes three inputs: the hidden states from the adjacent LSTM cells,</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">− → h (k+1) i−1 ∈R H or ← − h (k+1)</formula><p>i+1 ∈R H , the hidden state from the previous layer h </p><formula xml:id="formula_2">− → h (k+1) i , ← − h (k+1) i =bLSTM(f (h (k) i , z (k) ),<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">− → h (k+1) i−1 , ← − h (k+1) i+1 )<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">h (k+1) i = W 2 [ − → h (k+1) i , ← − h (k+1) i ]<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where i=1..I indicates the index of each token in the sequence. The message z (k) received by any agent a in layer k is the average of the outputs of the other agents from layer k:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">z (k) = 1 M −1 m =a h (k) m,I<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where h (k) m,I is the last hidden state output from the kth contextual layer of each agent where m = a. Here, we take the average of the messages received from other encoder agents, but a parametric function such as a feed forward model or an attention over messages could also be used.</p><p>The message z (k) is projected with the agent's previous encoding of its document:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f (h (k) i , z (k) ) = v T 1 tanh(W 3 h (k) i + W 4 z (k) ) (7)</formula><p>where v 1 , W 3 , and W 4 are learned parameters shared by every agent. Equation (7) combines the information sent by other agents with the context of the current token from this paragraph. This yields different features about the current context in relation to other topics in the source document.</p><p>At each layer, the agent modifies its representation of its own context relative to the information received from other agents, and updates the information it sends to other agents accordingly. a as additional input to its next layer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Decoder with Agent Attention</head><p>The output from the last contextual encoder layer of each agent {h</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">(K)</formula><p>a,i } I , which is a sequence of hidden state vectors of each token i, is sent to the decoder to calculate word-attention distributions. We use a single-layer LSTM for the decoder and feed the last hidden state from the first agent</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">s 0 = h (K)</formula><p>1,I as the initial state. At each time step t, the decoder predicts a new word in the summary w t and computes a new state s t by attending to relevant input context provided by the agents.</p><p>The decoder uses a new hierarchical attention mechanism over the agents. First, a word attention distribution l t a ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al. (2015)</ref>) is computed over every token {h <ref type="bibr">(K)</ref> a,i } I for each agent a:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">l t a = softmax(v T 2 tanh(W 5 h (K) a + W 6 s t + b 1 ))<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where l t a ∈[0, 1] I is the attention over all tokens in a paragraph x a and v 2 , W 5 , W 6 , b 1 are learned parameters. For each decoding step t, a new decoder context is calculated for each agent:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">c t a = i l t a,i h (K) a,i<label>(9)</label></formula><p>which is the weighted sum of the encoder hidden states of agent a. Each word context vector represents the information extracted by the agent from the paragraph it has read. Here the decoder has to decide which information is more relevant to the current decoding step t. This is done by weighting each context vector by an agent attention yielding the document global agent attention distribution g t (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>):</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">g t = softmax(v T 3 tanh(W 7 c t + W 8 s t + b 2 )) (10)</formula><p>where v 3 , W 7 , W 8 , and b 2 are learned, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">g t ∈[0,1] M is a soft selection over M agents.</formula><p>Then, we compute the agent context vector c * t :</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">c * t = a g t a c t a<label>(11)</label></formula><p>The agent context c * t ∈R H is a fixed length vector encoding salient information from the entire document provided by the agents. It is then concatenated with the decoder state s t and fed through a multi-layer perception to produce a vocabulary distribution (over all vocabulary words) at time t:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">P voc (w t |s t , w t−1 ) = softmax(MLP([s t , c * t ]))<label>(12)</label></formula><p>To keep the topics of generated sentences intact, it is reasonable that the decoder utilize the same agents over the course of short sequences (e.g., within a sentence). Because the decoder is designed to select which agent to attend to at each time step, we introduce contextual agent attention (caa) to prevent it from frequently switching between agents. The previous step's agent attention c * t−1 is used as additional information to the decoding step to generate a distribution over words:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">P voc (w t |·) = softmax(MLP([s t , c * t , c * t−1 ])) (13)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Multi-Agent Pointer Network</head><p>Similar to <ref type="bibr">See et al. (2017)</ref>, we allow for copying candidate words from different paragraphs of the document by computing a generation probability value for each agent p t a ∈[0,1] at each timestep t using the context vector c t a , decoder state s t and decoder input y t :</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">p t a = σ(v T 5 c t a + v T 6 s t + v T 7 y t + b)<label>(14)</label></formula><p>where b is a learned scalar, y t is the groundtruth/predicted output (depending on the training/testing time). The generation probability determines whether to generate a word from the vocabulary by sampling from P voc (w|·), or copying a word from the corresponding agent's input paragraph x a by sampling from its attention distribution l t a . This produces an extended vocabulary that includes words in the document that are considered out-of-vocabulary (OOV). A probability distribution over the extended vocabulary is computed for each agent:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">P a (w t |·) = p t a P voc (w t |·) + (1 − p t a )u t a,w (15)</formula><p>where u t a,w is the sum of the attention for all instances where w appears in the source document. The final distribution over the extended vocabulary, from which we sample, is obtained by weighting each agent by their corresponding agent attention values g t a :</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">P (w t |s t , w t−1 ) = a g t a P a (w t |·)<label>(16)</label></formula><p>In contrast to a single-agent baseline <ref type="bibr">(See et al., 2017)</ref>, our model allows each agent to vote for different OOV words at time t (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(16)</ref>). In such a case, only the word that is relevant to the generated summary up to time t is collaboratively voted as a result of agent attention probability g t a .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Mixed Objective Learning</head><p>To train the deep communicating agents, we use a mixed training objective that jointly optimizes multiple losses, which we describe below.</p><p>MLE Our baseline multi-agent model uses maximum likelihood training for sequence generation. Given y * = {y * 1 ,y * 2 ,...,y * T } as the groundtruth output sequence (human summary word sequences) for a given input document d, we minimize the negative log-likelihood of the target word sequence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">L MLE = − N t=1 logp(y * t |y * 1 . . . y * t−1 , d) (17)</formula><p>Semantic Cohesion To encourage sentences in the summary to be informative without repetition, we include a semantic cohesion loss to integrate sentence-level semantics into the learning objective. As the decoder generates the output word sequence {y 1 , y 2 . . . y T }, it keeps track of the end of sentence delimiter token ('.') indices. The hidden state vectors at the end of each sentence s q , q=1. . . Q, where s q ∈{s t :y t ='·', 1≤t≤T }, are used to compute the cosine similarity between two consecutively generated sentences. To minimize the similarity between end-of-sentence hidden states we define a semantic cohesion loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">L SEM = Q q=2 cos(s q , s q−1 )<label>(18)</label></formula><p>The final training objective is then:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">L MLE-SEM = L MLE + λL SEM (19)</formula><p>where λ is a tunable hyperparameter.</p><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) Loss Policy gradient methods can directly optimize discrete target evaluation metrics such as ROUGE that are non-differentiable ( <ref type="bibr">Paulus et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jaques et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pasunuru and Bansal, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wu et al., 2016)</ref>. At each time step, the word generated by the model can be viewed as an action taken by an RL agent. Once the full sequencê y is generated, it is compared against the ground truth sequence y * to compute the reward r(ˆ y).</p><p>Our model learns using a self-critical training approach ( <ref type="bibr">Rennie et al., 2016)</ref>, which learns by exploring new sequences and comparing them to the best greedily decoded sequence. For each training example d, two output sequences are generated: ˆ y, which is sampled from the probability distribution at each time step, p(ˆ y t |ˆy|ˆy 1 . . . ˆ y t−1 , d), and˜yand˜ and˜y, the baseline output, which is greedily generated by argmax decoding from p(˜ y t |˜y|˜y 1 . . .</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">˜ y t−1 , d).</formula><p>The training objective is then to minimize:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">L RL = (r(˜ y) − r(ˆ y)) N t=1 logp(ˆ y t |ˆy|ˆy 1 . . . ˆ y t−1 , d)<label>(20)</label></formula><p>This loss ensures that, with better exploration, the model learns to generate sequencesˆysequencesˆ sequencesˆy that receive higher rewards compared to the baseline˜ybaseline˜ baseline˜y, increasing overall reward expectation of the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mixed Loss</head><p>While training with only MLE loss will learn a better language model, this may not guarantee better results on global performance measures. Similarly, optimizing with only RL loss may increase the reward gathered at the expense of diminished readability and fluency of the generated summary ( <ref type="bibr">Paulus et al., 2018)</ref>. A combination of the two objectives can yield improved task-specific scores while maintaining fluency:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">L MIXED = γL RL + (1 − γ)L MLE (21)</formula><p>where γ is a tunable hyperparameter used to balance the two objective functions. We pre-train our models with MLE loss, and then switch to the mixed loss. We can also add the semantic cohesion loss term:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">L MIXED-SEM = γL RL +(1−γ)L MLE-SEM</formula><p>to analyze its impact in RL training.</p><p>Intermediate Rewards We introduce sentencebased rewards as opposed to end of summary rewards, using differential ROUGE metrics, to promote generating diverse sentences. Rather than rewarding sentences based on the scores obtained at the end of the generated summary, we compute incremental rouge scores of a generated sentencê o q :</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">r(ˆ o q ) = r([ˆ o 1 , . . . ˆ o q ]) − r([ˆ o 1 , . . . ˆ o q−1 ]) (22)</formula><p>Sentences are rewarded for the increase in ROUGE they contribute to the full sequence, ensuring that the current sentence contributed novel information to the overall summary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experimental Setup</head><p>Datasets We conducted experiments on two summarization datasets: CNN/DailyMail ( <ref type="bibr">Nallapati et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hermann et al., 2015)</ref> and New York Times (NYT) <ref type="bibr">(Sandhaus, 2008)</ref>. We replicate the preprocessing steps of <ref type="bibr">Paulus et al. (2018)</ref> to obtain the same data splits, except that we do not anonymize named entities. For our DCA models, we initialize the number of agents before training, and partition the document among the agents (i.e., three agent → three paragraphs). Additional details can be found in Appendix A.1.</p><p>Training Details During training and testing we truncate the article to 800 tokens and limit the length of the summary to 100 tokens for training and 110 tokens at test time. We distribute the truncated articles among agents for multi-agent models, preserving the paragraph and sentences as possible. For both datasets, we limit the input and output vocabulary size to the 50,000 most frequent tokens in the training set. We train with up to two contextual layers in all the DCA models as more layers did not provide additional performance gains. We fix γ = 0.97 for the RL term in Equation <ref type="formula">(21)</ref> and λ = 0.1 for the SEM term in MLE and MIXED training. Additional details are provided in Appendix A.2.</p><p>Evaluation We evaluate our system using ROUGE-1 (unigram recall), ROUGE-2 (bigram recall) and ROUGE-L (longest common sequence). <ref type="bibr">1</ref> We select the MLE models with the lowest negative log-likelihood and the MLE+RL models with the highest ROUGE-L scores on a sample of validation data to evaluate on the test Model ROUGE-1 ROUGE-2 ROUGE-L SummaRuNNer ( <ref type="bibr">Nallapati et al., 2017)</ref> 39.60 16.20 35.30 graph-based attention <ref type="bibr">(Tan et al., 2017)</ref> 38.01 13.90 34.00 pointer generator ( <ref type="bibr">See et al., 2017)</ref> 36   The rest of our models use 3 agents and incrementally add one component. First, we add the semantic cohesion loss (m4). Then, we add multi-agent pointer networks (mpgen) and agent communication (m5). Finally, we add contextual agent attention (caa) (m6), and train with the mixed MLE+RL+SEM loss (m7). All DCA models use pointer networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Quantitative Analysis</head><p>We show our results on the CNN/DailyMail and NYT datasets in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> and 2 respectively. Overall, our (m6) and (m7) models with multiagent encoders, pointer generation, and communication are the strongest models on ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2. While weaker on ROUGE-L than the RL model from <ref type="bibr">Paulus et al. (2018)</ref>, the human evaluations in that work showed that their model received lower readability and relevance scores than a model trained with MLE, indicating the additional boost in ROUGE-L was not correlated with summary quality. This result can also account for our best models being more abstractive. Our models use mixed loss not just to op-timize for sentence level structure similarity with the reference summary (to get higher ROUGE as reward), but also to learn parameters to improve semantic coherence, promoting higher abstraction (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> and Appendix B for generated summary examples).  Single vs. Multi-Agents All multi-agent models show improvements over the single agent baselines. On the CNN/DailyMail dataset, compared to MLE published baselines, we improve across all ROUGE scores. We found that the 3-agent models generally outperformed both 2-and 5-agent models (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>). This is in part because we truncate documents before training and the larger number of agents might be more efficient for multi-document summarization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model</head><p>Independent vs. Communicating Agents When trained on multiple agents with no communication (m4), the performance of our DCA models is similar to the single agent baselines (m1) and (m3). With communication, the biggest jump in ROUGE is seen on the CNN/DailyMail data, indicating that the encoders can better identify the key facts in the input, thereby avoiding unnecessary details.</p><p>Contextual Agent Attention (caa) Compared to the model with no contextualized agent attention (m5), the (m6) model yields better ROUGE scores. The stability provided by the caa helps the decoder avoid frequent switches between agents that would dilute the topical signal captured by each encoder.</p><p>Repetition Penalty As neurally generated summaries can be redundant, we introduced the semantic cohesion penalty and incremental rewards for RL to generate semantically diverse summaries. Our baseline model optimized together with SEM loss (m2) improves on all ROUGE scores over the baseline (m1). Similarly, our model trained with reinforcement learning uses sentence based intermediate rewards, which also improves ROUGE scores across both datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Human Evaluations</head><p>We perform human evaluations to establish that our model's ROUGE improvements are correlated with human judgments. We measure the communicative multi-agent network with contextual agent attention in comparison to a single-agent network with no communication. We use the following as evaluation criteria for generated summaries: (1) non-redundancy, fewer of the same ideas are repeated, (2) coherence, ideas are expressed clearly; (3) focus, the main ideas of the document are shared while avoiding superfluous details, and (4) overall, the summary effectively communicates the article's content. The focus and non-redundancy dimensions help quantify the impact of multi-agent communication in our model, while coherence helps to evaluate the impact of the reward based learning and repetition penalty of the proposed models.</p><p>Evaluation Procedure We randomly selected 100 samples from the CNN/DailyMail test set and use workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk as judges to evaluate them on the four criteria defined above. Judges are shown the original document, the ground truth summary, and two model summaries and are asked to evaluate each summary on the four criteria using a Likert scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The ground truth and model summaries are presented to the judges in random order. Each summary is rated by 5 judges and the results are averaged across all examples and judges.</p><p>We also performed a head-to-head evaluation (more common in DUC style evaluations) and randomly show two model generated summaries. We ask the human annotators to rate each summary on the same metrics as before without seeing the source document or ground truth summaries.</p><p>Results Human evaluators significantly prefer summaries generated by the communicating encoders. In the rating task, evaluators preferred the multi-agent summaries to the single-agent cases for all metrics. In the head-to-head evaluation, humans consistently preferred the DCA summaries to those generated by a single agent. In both the head-to-head and the rating evaluation, the largest improvement for the DCA model was on the focus question, indicating that the model learns to generate summaries with more pertinent details by capturing salient information from later portions of the document.</p><p>Human Mr Turnbull was interviewed about his childhood and his political stance.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Communication improves focus</head><p>To investigate how much the multi-agent models discover salient concepts in comparison to single agent models, we analyze ROUGE-L scores based on the average attention received by each agent. We compute the average attention received by each agent per decoding time step for every generated summary in the CNN/Daily Mail test corpus, bin the document-summary pairs by the attention received by each agent, and average the ROUGE-L scores for the summaries in each bin. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref> outlines two interesting results. First, summaries generated with a more distributed attention over the agents yield higher ROUGE-L scores, indicating that attending to multiple areas of the document allows the discovery of salient concepts in the later sections of the text. Second, if we use the same bins and generate summaries for the documents in each bin using the singleagent model, the average ROUGE-L scores for the single-agent summaries are lower than for the cor- responding multi-agent summaries, indicating that even in cases where one agent dominates the attention, communication between agents allows the model to generate more focused summaries. Qualitatively, we see this effect in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref>, where we compare the human generated summaries against our best single agent model (m3) and our best multi-agent model (m7). Model (m3) generates good summaries but does not capture all the facts in the human summary, while (m7) is able to include all the facts with few extra details, generating more relevant and diverse summaries.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Related Work</head><p>Several recent works investigate attention mechanisms for encoder-decoder models to sharpen the context that the decoder should focus on within the input encoding ( <ref type="bibr">Luong et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vinyals et al., 2015b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al., 2015)</ref>.

While we share the same motivation as these works, our work uniquely presents an approach based on CommNet, the deep communicating agent framework ( <ref type="bibr">Sukhbaatar et al., 2016</ref>). Compared to prior multi-agent works on logic puzzles <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Foerster et al., 2017)</ref>, language learning ( <ref type="bibr">Lazaridou et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mordatch and Abbeel, 2017)</ref> and starcraft games ( <ref type="bibr">Vinyals et al., 2017)</ref>, we present the first study in using this framework for long text generation. Finally, our model is related to prior works that address repetitions in generating long text. <ref type="bibr">See et al. (2017)</ref> introduce a post-trained coverage network to penalize repeated attentions over the same regions in the input, while <ref type="bibr">Paulus et al. (2018)</ref> use intra-decoder attention to punish generating the same words. In contrast, we propose a new semantic coherence loss and intermediate sentencebased rewards for reinforcement learning to discourage semantically similar generations ( §3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>We investigated the problem of encoding long text to generate abstractive summaries and demonstrated that the use of deep communicating agents can improve summarization by both automatic and manual evaluation.

For both datasets, we limit the input and output vocabulary size to the 50,000 most frequent tokens in the training set. We initialize word embeddings with 200-d GloVe vectors <ref type="bibr">(Pennington et al., 2014</ref>) and finetune them during training. We train using Adam with a learning rate of 0.001 for the MLE models and 10 −5 for the MLE+RL models. We tune the gamma hyper-parameter in the mixed loss by iterating γ={0.95, 0.97, 0.99}. In almost all DCA models, the 0.97 value yielded the best gains. We train our models for 200,000 iterations. which took 4-5 days for 2-3 agents and 5-6 days for 5 agents since it has more encoder parameters to tune.</p><p>To avoid repetition, we prevent the decoder from generating the same trigram more than once during test, following <ref type="bibr">Paulus et.al. (2018)</ref>. In addition, for every predicted out-of-vocabulary token (UNK), we replace it with its most likely origin by choosing the source word w with the largest cascaded attention w := arg max <ref type="formula" target="#formula_9">(8)</ref>, <ref type="formula">(10)</ref>).</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">a,i l t a,i * g t a (Eq.</formula></div>

This can be attributed to the fact that agents can successfully encode salient aspects distributed in distant sections of the document. An interesting result is that even though the multiagent model shows extractive behaviour in this example, it successfully selects the most salient sentences while the single agent model includes superfluous details.
