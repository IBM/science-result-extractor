			<abstract>
				<p>Relation classification is an important semantic processing task in the field of natural language processing (NLP). State-of-the-art systems still rely on lexical resources such as WordNet or NLP systems like dependency parser and named entity recognizers (NER) to get high-level features. Another challenge is that important information can appear at any position in the sentence. To tackle these problems, we propose Attention-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks(Att-BLSTM) to capture the most important semantic information in a sentence. The experimental results on the SemEval-2010 relation classification task show that our method outperforms most of the existing methods, with only word vectors.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Relation classification is the task of finding semantic relations between pairs of nominals, which is useful for many NLP applications, such as information extraction ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wu and Weld, 2010)</ref>, question answering ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Yao and Van Durme, 2014</ref>). For instance, the following sentence contains an example of the Entity-Destination relation between the nominals Flowers and chapel. ⟨e 1 ⟩ Flowers ⟨/e 1 ⟩ are carried into the ⟨e 2 ⟩ chapel ⟨/e 2 ⟩. ⟨e 1 ⟩, ⟨/e 1 ⟩, ⟨e 2 ⟩, ⟨/e 2 ⟩ are four position indicators which specify the starting and ending of the nominals ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Hendrickx et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Traditional relation classification methods that employ handcrafted features from lexical resources, are usually based on pattern matching, and have achieved high performance (Bunescu * Correspondence author: zhenyu.qi@ia.ac.cn and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Mooney, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mintz et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rink and Harabagiu, 2010)</ref>. One downside of these methods is that many traditional NLP systems are utilized to extract high-level features, such as part of speech tags, shortest dependency path and named entities, which consequently results in the increase of computational cost and additional propagation errors. Another downside is that designing features manually is time-consuming, and performing poor on generalization due to the low coverage of different training datasets.</p><p>Recently, deep learning methods provide an effective way of reducing the number of handcrafted features <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Socher et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zeng et al., 2014</ref>). However, these approaches still use lexical resources such as WordNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Miller, 1995)</ref> or NLP systems like dependency parsers and NER to get high-level features.</p><p>This paper proposes a novel neural network Att-BLSTM for relation classification. Our model utilizes neural attention mechanism with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks(BLSTM) to capture the most important semantic information in a sentence. This model doesn't utilize any features derived from lexical resources or NLP systems.</p><p>The contribution of this paper is using BLST-M with attention mechanism, which can automatically focus on the words that have decisive effect on classification, to capture the most important semantic information in a sentence, without using extra knowledge and NLP systems. We conduct experiments on the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset, and achieve an F 1-score of 84.0%, higher than most of the existing methods in the literature.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we review related work about relation classification. Section 3 presents our Att-BLSTM model in detail. In Section 4, we describe details about the setup of experimental evaluation and the experimental results. Finally, we have our conclusion in Section 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Over the years, various methods have been proposed for relation classification. Most of them are based on pattern matching and apply extra NLP systems to derive lexical features. One related work is proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Rink and Harabagiu (2010)</ref>, which utilizes many features derived from external corpora for a Support Vector Machine(SVM) classifier.</p><p>Recently, deep neural networks can learn underlying features automatically and have been used in the literature. Most representative progress was made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zeng et al. (2014)</ref>, who utilized convolutional neural networks(CNN) for relation classification. While CNN is not suitable for learning long-distance semantic information, so our approach builds on Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mikolov et al., 2010</ref>).</p><p>One related work was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Zhang and Wang (2015)</ref>, which employed bidirectional RN-N to learn patterns of relations from raw text data. Although bidirectional RNN has access to both past and future context information, the range of context is limited due to the vanishing gradient problem. To overcome this problem, Long short-Term memory(LSTM) units are introduced by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997)</ref>.</p><p>Another related work is SDP-LSTM model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Yan et al. (2015)</ref>. This model leverages the shortest dependency path(SDP) between two nominals, then it picks up heterogeneous information along the SDP with LSTM units. While our method regards the raw text as a sequence.</p><p>Finally, our work is related to BLSTM model proposed by . This model utilizing NLP tools and lexical resources to get word, position, POS, NER, dependency parse and hypernym features, together with LSTM units, achieved a comparable result to the state-ofthe-art. However, comparing to the complicated features that employed by , our method regards the four position indicators ⟨e1⟩, ⟨/e1⟩, ⟨e2⟩, ⟨/e2⟩ as single words, and transforms all words to word vectors, forming a simple but competing model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Model</head><p>In this section we propose Att-BLSTM model in detail. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, the model proposed in this paper contains five components:</p><p>(1) Input layer: input sentence to this model; (2) Embedding layer: map each word into a low dimension vector; (3) LSTM layer: utilize BLSTM to get high level features from step <ref type="formula">(2)</ref>; (4) Attention layer: produce a weight vector, and merge word-level features from each time step into a sentence-level feature vector, by multiplying the weight vector;</p><p>(5) Output layer: the sentence-level feature vector is finally used for relation classification.</p><p>These components will be presented in detail in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Word Embeddings</head><p>Given a sentence consisting of T words S = {x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x T }, every word x i is converted into a real-valued vector e i . For each word in S, we first look up the embedding matrix W wrd ∈ R d w |V | , where V is a fixed-sized vocabulary, and d w is the size of word embedding. The matrix W wrd is a parameter to be learned, and d w is a hyper-parameter to be chosen by user. We transform a word x i into its word embedding e i by using the matrix-vector product:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">e i = W wrd v i (1)</formula><p>where v i is a vector of size |V | which has value 1 at index e i and 0 in all other positions. Then the sentence is feed into the next layer as a real-valued vectors emb s = {e 1 , e 2 , . . . , e T } .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Bidirectional Network</head><p>LSTM units are firstly proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997)</ref> to overcome gradient vanishing problem. The main idea is to introduce an adaptive gating mechanism, which decides the degree to which LSTM units keep the previous state and memorize the extracted features of the current data input. Then lots of LSTM variants have been proposed. We adopt a variant introduced by , which adds weighted peephole connections from the Constant Error Carousel (CEC) to the gates of the same memory block. By directly employing the current cell state to generate the gate degrees, the peephole connections allow all gates to inspect into the cell (i.e.   , all of those gates are set to generate some degrees, using current input x i , the state h i−1 that previous step generated , and current state of this cell c i−1 (peephole), for the decisions whether to take the inputs, forget the memory stored before, and output the state generated later. Just as these following equations demonstrate:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">i t = σ(W xi x t + W hi h t−1 + W ci c t−1 + b i ) (2) f t = σ(W xf x t +W hf h t−1 +W cf c t−1 + b f ) (3) g t = tanh(W xc x t +W hc h t−1 +W cc c t−1 +b c ) (4) c t = i t g t + f t c t−1<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">o t = σ(W xo x t + W ho h t−1 + W co c t + b o ) (6) h t = o t tanh(c t )<label>(7)</label></formula><p>Hence, current cell state c t will be generated by calculating the weighted sum using both previous cell state and current information generated by the cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Graves, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>For many sequence modelling tasks, it is beneficial to have access to future as well as past context. However, standard LSTM networks process sequences in temporal order, they ignore future context. Bidirectional LSTM networks extend the unidirectional LSTM networks by introducing a second layer, where the hidden to hidden connections flow in opposite temporal order. The model is therefore able to exploit information both from the past and the future.</p><p>In this paper, we use BLSTM. As also shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, the network contains two sub-networks for the left and right sequence context, which are forward and backward pass respectively. The output of the i th word is shown in the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">h i = [ − → h i ⊕ ← − h i ]<label>(8)</label></formula><p>Here, we use element-wise sum to combine the forward and backward pass outputs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Attention</head><p>Attentive neural networks have recently demonstrated success in a wide range of tasks ranging from question answering, machine translations, speech recognition, to image captioning (Hermann et al., 2015; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chorows- ki et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Xu et al., 2015)</ref>. In this section, we propose the attention mechanism for relation classification tasks. Let H be a matrix consisting of output vectors[h 1 , h 2 , . . . , h T ] that the LSTM layer produced, where T is the sentence length. The representation r of the sentence is formed by a weighted sum of these output vectors:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">M = tanh(H)<label>(9)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_5">α = sof tmax(w T M )<label>(10)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">r = Hα T<label>(11)</label></formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Regularization</head><p>Dropout, proposed by (Hinton et al., 2012), prevents co-adaptation of hidden units by randomly omitting feature detectors from the network during forward propagation. We employ dropout on the embedding layer, LSTM layer and the penultimate layer. We additionally constrain L2-norms of the weight vectors by rescaling w to have ∥w∥ = s, whenever ∥w∥ &gt; s after a gradient descent step, as shown in equation 15. Training details are further introduced in Section 4.1.</p></div>
