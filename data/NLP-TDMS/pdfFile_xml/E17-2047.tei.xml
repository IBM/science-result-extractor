<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The RNN-based encoder-decoder (EncDec) approach has recently been providing significant progress in various natural language generation (NLG) tasks, i.e., machine translation (MT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref> and abstractive summarization (ABS) ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rush et al., 2015)</ref>. Since a scheme in this approach can be interpreted as a conditional language model, it is suitable for NLG tasks. However, one potential weakness is that it sometimes repeatedly generates the same phrase (or word).</p><p>This issue has been discussed in the neural MT (NMT) literature as a part of a coverage problem ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tu et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mi et al., 2016)</ref>. Such repeating generation behavior can become more severe in some NLG tasks than in MT. The very short ABS task in <ref type="bibr">DUC-2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">and 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Over et al., 2007</ref>) is a typical example because it requires the generation of a summary in a pre-defined limited output space, such as ten words or 75 bytes. Thus, the repeated output consumes precious limited output space. Unfortunately, the coverage approach cannot be directly applied to ABS tasks since they require us to optimally find salient ideas from the input in a lossy compression manner, and thus the summary (output) length hardly depends on the input length; an MT task is mainly loss-less generation and nearly one-to-one correspondence between input and output ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Nallapati et al., 2016a)</ref>.</p><p>From this background, this paper tackles this issue and proposes a method to overcome it in ABS tasks. The basic idea of our method is to jointly estimate the upper-bound frequency of each target vocabulary that can occur in a summary during the encoding process and exploit the estimation to control the output words in each decoding step. We refer to our additional component as a wordfrequency estimation (WFE) sub-model. The WFE sub-model explicitly manages how many times each word has been generated so far and might be generated in the future during the decoding process. Thus, we expect to decisively prohibit excessive generation. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on well-studied ABS benchmark data provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rush et al. (2015)</ref>, and evaluated in ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chopra et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Nallapati et al., 2016b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kikuchi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Takase et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ayana et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gulcehre et al., 2016</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Baseline RNN-based EncDec Model</head><p>The baseline of our proposal is an RNN-based EncDec model with an attention mechanism ( <ref type="bibr">Lu- ong et al., 2015)</ref>. In fact, this model has already been used as a strong baseline for ABS tasks ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chopra et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Kikuchi et al., 2016</ref>) as well as in the NMT literature. More specifically, as a case study we employ a 2-layer bidirectional LSTM encoder and a 2-layer LSTM decoder with a global attention ( ). We omit a detailed review of the descriptions due to space limitations. The following are the necessary parts for explaining our proposed method.</p><p>Let X = (x i ) I i=1 and Y = (y j ) J j=1 be input and output sequences, respectively, where x i and Input: H s = (h s i ) I i=1 list of hidden states generated by encoder Initialize: s ← 0 s: cumulative log-likelihoodˆY likelihoodˆ likelihoodˆY ← 'BOSˆY BOSˆ BOSˆY : list of generated words H t ← H s H t : hidden states to process decoder 1: h ← (s, ˆ Y , H t ) triplet of (minimal) info for decoding process 2: Qw ← push(Qw, h) set initial triplet h to priority queue Qw 3: Qc ← {} prepare queue to store complete sentences 4: Repeat 5:</p><p>˜ O ← () prepare empty list 6: Repeat 7:</p><p>h ← pop(Qw) pop a candidate history 8:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">˜ o ← calcLL(h) see Eq. 2 9: ˜ O ← append( ˜ O, ˜ o) append likelihood vector 10: Until Qw = ∅ repeat until Qw is empty 11: {( ˆ m, ˆ k)z} K−C z=1 ← findKBest( ˜ O) 12: {hz} K−C z=1 ← makeTriplet({( ˆ m, ˆ k)z} K−C z=1 ) 13: Q ← selectTopK(Qc, {hz} K−C z=1 ) 14: (Qw, Qc) ← SepComp(Q ) separate Q into Qc or Qw 15: Until Qw = ∅ finish if</formula><p>Qw is empty Output: Qc <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Algorithm for a K-best beam search decoding typically used in EncDec approach.</p><p>y j are one-hot vectors, which correspond to the i-th word in the input and the j-th word in the output. Let V t denote the vocabulary (set of words) of output. For simplification, this paper uses the following four notation rules:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">(1) (x i ) I i=1</formula><p>is a short notation for representing a list of (column) vectors, i.e., (x 1 , . . . , Encoder: Let Ω s (·) denote the overall process of our 2-layer bidirectional LSTM encoder. The encoder receives input X and returns a list of final hidden states</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">x I ) = (x i ) I i=1 . (2) v(a, D) represents a D-dimensional (column)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_3">H s = (h s i ) I i=1 : H s = Ω s (X).<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Decoder: We employ a K-best beam-search decoder to find the (approximated) best outputˆYoutputˆ outputˆY given input X. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> shows a typical Kbest beam search algorithm used in the decoder of EncDec approach. We define the (minimal) required information h shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> for the jth decoding process is the following triplet, h = (</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">s j−1 , ˆ Y j−1 , H t j−1 )</formula><p>, where s j−1 is the cumulative log-likelihood from step 0 to j − 1,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">ˆ Y j−1</formula><p>is a (candidate of) output word sequence generated so far from step 0 to j − 1, that is, ˆ Y j−1 = (y 0 , . . . , y j−1 ) and H t j−1 is the all the hidden states for calculating the j-th decoding process. Then, the function calcLL in Line 8 can be written as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">˜ o j = v s j−1 , M + log Softmax(o j ) o j = Ω t H s , H t j−1 , ˆ y j−1 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where Softmax(·) is the softmax function for a given vector and Ω t (·) represents the overall process of a single decoding step.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Moreover, ˜ O in Line 11 is a (M × (K − C))- matrix,</formula><p>where C is the number of complete sentences in Q c . The (m, k)-element of˜Oof˜ of˜O represents a likelihood of the m-th word, namelyõnamely˜namelyõ j <ref type="bibr">[m]</ref>, that is calculated using the k-th candidate in Q w at the (j − 1)-th step. In Line 12, the function makeTriplet constructs a set of triplets based on the information of index ( ˆ m, ˆ k). Then, in Line 13, the function selectTopK selects the top-K candidates from union of a set of generated triplets at current step {h z } K−C z=1 and a set of triplets of complete sentences in Q c . Finally, the function sepComp in Line 13 divides a set of triplets Q in two distinct sets whether they are complete sentences, Q c , or not, Q w . If the elements in Q are all complete sentences, namely, Q c = Q and Q w = ∅, then the algorithm stops according to the evaluation of Line 15.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Word Frequency Estimation</head><p>This section describes our proposed method, which roughly consists of two parts: (1) a submodel that estimates the upper-bound frequencies of the target vocabulary words in the output, and (2) architecture for controlling the output words in the decoder using estimations.</p></div>

Thus,</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ˆ r ∈ [0, +∞] M , ˆ g ∈ [0, 1] M , andâandˆandâ ∈ [0, +∞] M .</formula><p>We incorporate two separated components, ˆ r andˆgandˆ andˆg, to improve the frequency fitting. The purpose ofˆgofˆ ofˆg is to distinguish whether the target words occur or not, regardless of their frequency. Thus, ˆ g can be interpreted as a gate function that resembles estimating the fertility in the coverage ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tu et al., 2016</ref>) and a switch probability in the copy mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Gulcehre et al., 2016)</ref>. These ideas originated from such gated recurrent networks as LSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997</ref>) and GRU ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chung et al., 2014</ref>). Then, ˆ r can much focus on to model frequency equal to or larger than 1. This separation can be expected sincê r[m] has no influence ifˆgifˆ ifˆg[m] = 0.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Effective usage</head><p>The technical challenge of our method is effectively leveraging WFEâWFEˆWFEâ. Among several possible choices, we selected to integrate it as prior knowledge in the decoder. To do so, we re-defineõdefine˜defineõ j in Eq. 2 as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">˜ o j = v s j−1 , M + log (Softmax(o j )) + ˜ a j .</formula><p>The difference is the additional term ofãof˜ofã j , which is an adjusted likelihood for the j-th step originally calculated fromâfromˆfromâ. We defineãdefine˜defineã j as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">˜ a j = log (ClipReLU 1 (˜ r j ) ˆ g) .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>ClipReLU 1 (·) is a function that receives a vector and performs an element-wise calculation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">x [m] = max (0, min(1, x[m])</formula><p>) for all m if it receives x. We define the relation betweeñ r j in Eq. 4 andˆrandˆ andˆr in Eq. 3 as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">˜ r j = ˆ r if j = 1 ˜ r j−1 − ˆ y j−1 otherwise .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Eq. 5 is updated from˜rfrom˜ from˜r j−1 tõ r j with the estimated output of previous stepˆystepˆ stepˆy j−1 .

Thus, the interpretation of˜r of˜ of˜r j is that it directly manages the upper-bound frequency of each target word that can occur in the current and future decoding time steps. As a result, decoding with our method never generates words that exceed the estimationˆrestimationˆ estimationˆr, and thus we expect to reduce the redundant repeating generation.</p><p>Note here that our method never requires˜r requires˜ requires˜r j [m] ≤ 0 (or˜ror˜ or˜r j [m] = 0) for all m at the last decoding time step j, as is generally required in the occurrence estimation Output: (g, r)</p><note type="other">Input: H s = (h s i ) I i=1 list of hidden states generated by encoder Parameters: W r</note><formula xml:id="formula_15">1 , W g 1 ∈ R H×H , W r 2 ∈ R M ×H , W g 2 ∈ R M ×2H , 1: H r 1 ← W r 1 H s linear transformation for frequency model 2: h r 1 ← H r 1 v(1, M ) h r 1 ∈ R H ,</formula><p>Figure 2: Procedure for calculating the components of our WFE sub-model. coverage ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tu et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mi et al., 2016;</ref>. This is why we say upper-bound frequency estimation, not just (exact) frequency. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> shows the detailed procedure for calculating g and r in Eq. 3. For r, we sum up all of the features of the input given by the encoder (Line 2) and estimate the frequency. In contrast, for g, we expect Lines 5 and 6 to work as a kind of voting for both positive and negative directions since g needs just occurrence information, not frequency. For example, g may take large positive or negative values if a certain input word (feature) has a strong influence for occurring or not occurring specific target word(s) in the output. This idea is borrowed from the Max-pooling layer (Goodfellow et al., 2013).</p></div>

Clearly a * can be obtained by counting the words in the corresponding output. We define loss function Ψ wfe for estimating our WFE sub-model as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Ψ wfe X, a * , W = d · v(1, M ) (6) d = c 1 max v(0, M ), ˆ a − a * − v(, M ) b + c 2 max v(0, M ), a * − ˆ a − v(, M ) b ,</formula><p>where W represents the overall parameters.

The remaining 0.25 for both the positive and negative sides denotes the margin between every integer. We select b = 2 to penalize larger for more distant error, and c 1 &lt; c 2 , i.e., c 1 = 0.2, c 2 = 1, since we aim to obtain upper-bound estimation and to penalize the underestimation below the true frequency a * . Finally, we minimize Eq. 6 with a standard negative log-likelihood objective function to estimate the baseline EncDec model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>We investigated the effectiveness of our method on ABS experiments, which were first performed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rush et al., (2015)</ref>. The data consist of approximately 3.8 million training, 400,000 validation and 400,000 test data, respectively 2 . Generally, 1951 test data, randomly extracted from the test data section, are used for evaluation <ref type="bibr">3</ref> . Additionally, DUC-2004 evaluation data <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Over et al., 2007)</ref>  <ref type="bibr">4</ref> were also evaluated by the identical models trained on the above Gigaword data. We strictly followed the instructions of the evaluation setting used in previous studies for a fair comparison. Table 1 summarizes the model configuration and the parameter estimation setting in our experiments. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows the results of the baseline EncDec and our proposed EncDec+WFE.

For a validity confirmation of our EncDec baseline, we also performed OpenNMT tool 5 . The results on Gigaword data with B = 5 were, 33.65, 16.12, and 31.37 for ROUGE-1(F), ROUGE-2(F) and ROUGE-L(F), respectively, which were almost similar results (but slightly lower) with our implementation. This supports that our baseline worked well as a strong baseline. Clearly, EncDec+WFE significantly outperformed the strong EncDec baseline by a wide margin on the ROUGE scores. Thus, we conclude that the WFE sub-model has a positive impact to gain the ABS performance since performance gains were derived only by the effect of incorporating our WFE sub-model. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref> lists the current top system results. Our method EncDec+WFE successfully achieved the current best scores on most evaluations. This result also supports the effectiveness of incorporating our WFE sub-model. MRT ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ayana et al., 2016</ref>) previously provided the best results. Note that its model structure is nearly identical to our baseline.
