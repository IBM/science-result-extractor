				<p>Neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) approaches have proven to be successful in grammatical error correction (GEC). Based on the seq2seq framework, we propose a novel fluency boost learning and inference mechanism. Fluency boosting learning generates diverse error-corrected sentence pairs during training, enabling the error correction model to learn how to improve a sentence&apos;s fluency from more instances, while fluency boosting inference allows the model to correct a sentence incrementally with multiple inference steps. Combining fluency boost learning and inference with convolutional seq2seq models, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance: 75.72 (F 0.5) on CoNLL-2014 10 annotation dataset and 62.42 (GLEU) on JFLEG test set respectively, becoming the first GEC system that reaches human-level performance (72.58 for CoNLL and 62.37 for JFLEG) on both of the benchmarks.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Sutskever et al., 2014</ref>) for grammatical error correction (GEC) have drawn growing attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Xie et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Ji et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Schmaltz et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chollampatt &amp; Ng, 2018;</ref>) in recent years. However, most of the seq2seq models for GEC have two flaws. First, the seq2seq models are trained with only limited error-corrected sentence pairs like <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>(a). Limited by the size of training data, the models with millions of parameters may not be well generalized. Thus, it is common that the models fail to correct a sentence perfectly even if the sentence is slightly different from the training instance, as illustrated by <ref type="figure">Figure 1(b)</ref>. Second, the seq2seq models usually cannot perfectly correct a sentence with many grammatical errors through single-round seq2seq inference, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>(b) and 1(c), because some errors in a sentence may make the context strange, which confuses the models to correct other errors.</p><p>To address the above-mentioned limitations in model learning and inference, we propose a novel fluency boost learning and inference mechanism, illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>.</p><p>For fluency boosting learning, not only is a seq2seq model trained with original error-corrected sentence pairs, but also it generates less fluent sentences (e.g., from its n-best outputs) to establish new error-corrected sentence pairs by pairing them with their correct sentences during training, as long as the sentences' fluency 1 is below that of their correct sentences, as <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>(a) shows. Specifically, we call the generated error-corrected sentence pairs fluency boost sentence pairs because the sentence in the target side always improves fluency over that in the source side. The generated fluency boost sentence pairs during training will be used as additional training instances during subsequent training epochs, allowing the error correction model to see more grammatically incorrect sentences during training and accordingly improving its generalization ability.</p><p>For model inference, fluency boost inference mechanism allows the model to correct a sentence incrementally with multi-round inference as long as the proposed edits can boost the sentence's She see Tom is catched by policeman in park at last night.

For a sentence with multiple grammatical errors, some of the errors will be corrected first. The corrected parts will make the context clearer, which may benefit the model to correct the remaining errors. Moreover, based on the special characteristics of this task that the output prediction can be repeatedly edited and the basic fluency boost inference idea, we further propose a round-way correction approach that uses two seq2seq models whose decoding orders are left-to-right and right-to-left respectively. For round-way correction, a sentence will be corrected successively by the right-to-left and left-to-right seq2seq model 2 . Since the left-to-right and rightto-left decoder decode a sequence with different contexts, they have their unique advantages for specific error types. Round-way correction can fully exploit their pros and make them complement each other, which results in a significant improvement of recall.</p><p>Experiments show that combining fluency boost learning and inference with convolutional seq2seq models, our best GEC system 3 achieves 75.72 F 0.5 on CoNLL-2014 10 annotation dataset and 62.42 GLEU on JFLEG test set, becoming the first system reaching human-level performance on both of the GEC benchmarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND: NEURAL GRAMMATICAL ERROR CORRECTION</head><p>As neural machine translation (NMT), a typical neural GEC approach uses an encoder-decoder seq2seq model <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref>) with attention mechanism ( ) to edit a raw sentence into the grammatically correct sentence it should be, as <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>(a) shows.</p><p>Given a raw sentence x r = (x r 1 , · · · , x r M ) and its corrected sentence x c = (x c 1 , · · · , x c N ) in which x r M and x c N are the M -th and N -th words of sentence x r and x c respectively, the error correction seq2seq model learns a probabilistic mapping P (x c |x r ) from error-corrected sentence pairs through maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which learns model parameters Θ crt to maximize the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Θ * crt = arg max Θcrt (x r ,x c )∈S * log P (x c |x r ; Θ crt )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where S * denotes the set of error-corrected sentence pairs.</p><p>For model inference, an output sequence</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">x o = (x o 1 , · · · , x o i , · · · , x o L )</formula><p>is selected through beam search, which maximizes the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P (x o |x r ) = L i=1 P (x o i |x r , x o &lt;i ; Θ crt )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>3 FLUENCY BOOST LEARNING Conventional seq2seq models for GEC learn model parameters only from original error-corrected sentence pairs. However, such error-corrected sentence pairs are not sufficiently available. As a result, many neural GEC models are not very well generalized.</p><p>Fortunately, neural GEC is different from NMT. For neural GEC, its goal is improving a sentence's fluency 4 without changing its original meaning; thus, any sentence pair that satisfies this condition (we call it fluency boost condition) can be used as a training instance.</p><p>In this work, we define f (x) as the fluency score of a sentence x:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">f (x) = 1 1 + H(x)<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">H(x) = − |x| i=1 log P (x i |x &lt;i ) |x|<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where P (x i |x &lt;i ) is the probability of x i given context x &lt;i , computed by a language model, and |x| is the length of sentence x. H(x) is actually the cross entropy of the sentence x, whose range is</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">[0, +∞). Accordingly, the range of f (x) is (0, 1].</formula><p>The core idea of fluency boost learning is to generate fluency boost sentence pairs that satisfy the fluency boost condition during training, as <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>(a) illustrates, so that these pairs can further help model learning.</p><p>In this section, we present three fluency boost learning strategies: back-boost, self-boost, and dualboost that generate fluency boost sentence pairs in different ways, as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">BACK-BOOST LEARNING</head><p>Back-boost learning borrows the idea from back translation ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Sennrich et al., 2016</ref>) in NMT, referring to training a backward model (we call it error generation model, as opposed to error correction  model) that is used to convert a fluent sentence to a less fluent sentence with errors. Since the less fluent sentences are generated by the error generation seq2seq model trained with error-corrected data, they usually do not change the original sentence's meaning; thus, they can be paired with their correct sentences, establishing fluency boost sentence pairs that can be used as training instances for error correction models, as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3</ref>(a) shows.</p><p>Specifically, we first train a seq2seq error generation model Θ gen with S * which is identical to S * except that the source sentence and the target sentence are interchanged. Then, we use the model Θ gen to predict n-best outputs x o1 , · · · , x on given a correct sentence x c . Given the fluency boost condition, we compare the fluency of each output x ok (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n) to that of its correct sentence x c . If an output sentence's fluency score is much lower than its correct sentence, we call it a disfluency candidate of x c .</p><p>To formalize this process, we first define Y n (x; Θ) to denote the n-best outputs predicted by model Θ given the input x. Then, disfluency candidates of a correct sentence x c can be derived:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">D back (x c ) = {x ok |x ok ∈ Y n (x c ; Θ gen ) ∧ f (x c ) f (x ok ) ≥ σ} (5)</formula><p>where D back (x c ) denotes the disfluency candidate set for x c in back-boost learning. σ is a threshold to determine if x ok is less fluent than x c and it should be slightly larger 5 than 1.0, which helps filter out sentence pairs with unnecessary edits (e.g., I like this book. → I like the book.).</p><p>In the subsequent training epochs, the error correction model will not only learn from the original error-corrected sentence pairs (x r ,x c ), but also learn from fluency boost sentence pairs (x ok ,x c ) where</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">x ok is a sample of D back (x c ).</formula><p>We summarize this process in Algorithm 1 where S * is the set of original error-corrected sentence pairs, and S can be tentatively considered identical to S * when there is no additional native data to help model training (see Section 3.4). Note that we constrain the size of S t not to exceed |S * | (the 7th line in Algorithm 1) to avoid that too many fluency boost pairs overwhelm the effects of the original error-corrected pairs on model learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">SELF-BOOST LEARNING</head><p>In contrast to back-boost learning whose core idea is originally from NMT, self-boost learning is original, which is specially devised for neural GEC. The idea of self-boost learning is illustrated by <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 3</ref>(b) and was already briefly introduced in Section 1 and <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>(a). Unlike back-boost learning in which an error generation seq2seq model is trained to generate disfluency candidates, self-boost learning allows the error correction model to generate the candidates by itself.

Among the n-best outputs, any output that is not identical to x c can be considered as an error prediction. Instead of treating the error predictions useless, self-boost learning fully exploits them. Specifically, if an error prediction x ok is much less fluent than that of its correct sentence x c , it will be added to x c 's disfluency candidate set D self (x c ), as Eq <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">(6)</ref> shows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">D self (x c ) = D self (x c ) ∪ {x ok |x ok ∈ Y n (x r ; Θ crt ) ∧ f (x c ) f (x ok ) ≥ σ}<label>(6)</label></formula><p>In contrast to back-boost learning, self-boost generates disfluency candidates from a different perspective -by editing the raw sentence x r rather than the correct sentence x c .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">MULTI-ROUND ERROR CORRECTION</head><p>As we discuss in Section 1, some sentences with multiple grammatical errors usually cannot be perfectly corrected through normal seq2seq inference which makes only single-round inference. Fortunately, neural GEC is different from NMT: its source and target language are the same. The characteristic allows us to edit a sentence more than once through multi-round model inference, which motivates our fluency boost inference. As <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>(b) shows, fluency boost inference allows a sentence to be incrementally edited through multi-round seq2seq inference as long as the sentence's fluency can be improved. Specifically, an error correction seq2seq model first takes a raw sentence x r as an input and outputs a hypothesis x o1 . Instead of regarding x o1 as the final prediction, fluency boost inference will then take x o1 as the input to generate the next output x o2 . The process will not terminate unless x ot does not improve x o t−1 in terms of fluency.</p><p>She likes playing in park and come here every week.</p><p>She likes playing in the park and come here every week.</p><p>She likes playing in the park and comes here every week.</p><p>right-to-left left-to-right <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Round-way error correction: some types of errors (e.g., articles) are easier to be corrected by a right-to-left seq2seq model, while some (e.g., subject verb agreement) are more likely to be corrected by a left-to-right seq2seq model. Round-way error correction makes left-to-right and right-to-left seq2seq models well complement each other, enabling it to correct more grammatical errors than an individual model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">ROUND-WAY ERROR CORRECTION</head><p>Based on the idea of multi-round correction, we further propose an advanced fluency boost inference approach: round-way error correction. Instead of progressively correcting a sentence with the same seq2seq model as introduced in Section 4.1, round-way correction corrects a sentence through a right-to-left seq2seq model and a left-to-right seq2seq model successively, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>.</p><p>The motivation of round-way error correction is straightforward. Decoders with different decoding orders decode word sequences with different contexts, making them have their unique advantages for specific error types. For the example in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, the error of a lack of an article (i.e., park → the park) is more likely to be corrected by the right-to-left seq2seq model than the left-to-right one, because whether to add an article depends on the noun park that was already seen by the right-to-left model when it made the decision. In contrast, the left-to-right model might be better at dealing with subject-verb agreement errors (e.g., come → comes in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>) because the keyword that decides the verb form is its subject She which is at the beginning of the sentence.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bryant &amp; Ng (2015)</ref> that contains 10 human expert annotations for each test sentence. We evaluate systems' performance using both annotation settings for the CoNLL dataset. To distinguish between these two annotation settings, we use CoNLL-2014 to denote the original annotations, and CoNLL-10 to denote the 10-human annotations. As previous studies, we use CoNLL-2013 test set and JFLEG dev set as our development sets for CoNLL-2014 and JFLEG test set respectively.</p></div>

We compare our systems to human performance on CoNLL-10 and JFLEG benchmarks.

When we use round-way correction, the errors that are not corrected by the rightto-left model are likely to be corrected by the left-to-right one, which is reflected by the recall improvement of most error types, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_9">Table 5</ref>.  </p></div>

For example, top-performing systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rozovskaya et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Junczys-Dowmunt &amp; Grundkiewicz, 2014</ref>) in CoNLL-2014 shared task ( ) use either of the methods.

Unlike the models trained only with original error-corrected data, we propose a novel fluency boost learning mechanism for dynamic data augmentation along with training for GEC, despite some related studies that explore artificial error generation for GEC <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brockett et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Foster &amp; Andersen, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Rozovskaya &amp; Roth, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Rozovskaya et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Xie et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Xie et al., 2018</ref>). Moreover, we propose fluency boost inference which allows the model to repeatedly edit a sentence as long as the sentence's fluency can be improved. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first to conduct multi-round seq2seq inference for GEC, while similar ideas have been proposed for NMT <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Xia et al., 2017</ref>).</p><p>In addition to the studies on GEC, there is also much research on grammatical error detection ( <ref type="bibr">Lea- cock et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Rei &amp; Yannakoudakis, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kaneko et al., 2017)</ref> and GEC evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Tetreault et al., 2010b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Madnani et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dahlmeier &amp; Ng, 2012c;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Napoles et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bryant et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Asano et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Choshen &amp; Abend, 2018</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">CONCLUSION</head><p>We present a state-of-the-art convolutional seq2seq model based GEC system that uses a novel fluency boost learning and inference mechanism. Fluency boost learning fully exploits both errorcorrected data and native data by generating diverse error-corrected sentence pairs during training, which benefits model learning and improves the performance over the base seq2seq model, while fluency boost inference utilizes the characteristic of GEC to progressively improve a sentence's fluency through round-way correction. The powerful learning and inference mechanism enables our system to achieve state-of-the-art results and reach human-level performance on both CoNLL-2014 and JFLEG benchmark datasets.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>She sees Tom caught by a policeman in the park last night.
