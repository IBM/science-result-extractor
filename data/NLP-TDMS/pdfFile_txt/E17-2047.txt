Cutting-off Redundant Repeating Generations for Neural Abstractive Summarization
section: abstract
This paper tackles the reduction of redundant repeating generation that is often observed in RNN-based encoder-decoder models. Our basic idea is to jointly estimate the upper-bound frequency of each target vocabulary in the encoder and control the output words based on the estimation in the decoder. Our method shows significant improvement over a strong RNN-based encoder-decoder baseline and achieved its best results on an abstractive summarization benchmark.
section: Introduction
The RNN-based encoder-decoder (EncDec) approach has recently been providing significant progress in various natural language generation (NLG) tasks, i.e., machine translation (MT) and abstractive summarization (ABS) (. Since a scheme in this approach can be interpreted as a conditional language model, it is suitable for NLG tasks. However, one potential weakness is that it sometimes repeatedly generates the same phrase (or word).
This issue has been discussed in the neural MT (NMT) literature as apart of a coverage problem (. Such repeating generation behavior can become more severe in some NLG tasks than in MT. The very short ABS task in) is atypical example because it requires the generation of a summary in a pre-defined limited output space, such as ten words or 75 bytes. Thus, the repeated output consumes precious limited output space. Unfortunately, the coverage approach cannot be directly applied to ABS tasks since they require us to optimally find salient ideas from the input in a lossy compression manner, and thus the summary (output) length hardly depends on the input length; an MT task is mainly loss-less generation and nearly one-to-one correspondence between input and output (.
From this background, this paper tackles this issue and proposes a method to overcome it in ABS tasks. The basic idea of our method is to jointly estimate the upper-bound frequency of each target vocabulary that can occur in a summary during the encoding process and exploit the estimation to control the output words in each decoding step. We refer to our additional component as a wordfrequency estimation (WFE) sub-model. The WFE sub-model explicitly manages how many times each word has been generated so far and might be generated in the future during the decoding process. Thus, we expect to decisively prohibit excessive generation. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on well-studied ABS benchmark data provided by, and evaluated in ().
section: Baseline RNN-based EncDec Model
The baseline of our proposal is an RNN-based EncDec model with an attention mechanism (. In fact, this model has already been used as a strong baseline for ABS tasks () as well as in the NMT literature. More specifically, as a case study we employ a 2-layer bidirectional LSTM encoder and a 2-layer LSTM decoder with a global attention ( ). We omit a detailed review of the descriptions due to space limitations. The following are the necessary parts for explaining our proposed method.
Let X = (x i ) I i=1 and Y = (y j ) J j=1 be input and output sequences, respectively, where xi and Input: H s = (h s i ) I i=1 list of hidden states generated by encoder Initialize: s ← 0 s: cumulative log-likelihoodˆY likelihoodˆ likelihoodˆY ← 'BOSˆY BOSˆ BOSˆY : list of generated words H t ← H s H t : hidden states to process decoder 1: h ← (s, ˆ Y , H t ) triplet of (minimal) info for decoding process 2: Qw ← push(Qw, h) set initial triplet h to priority queue Qw 3: Qc ← {} prepare queue to store complete sentences 4: Repeat 5:

y j are one-hot vectors, which correspond to the i-th word in the input and the j-th word in the output. Let Vt denote the vocabulary (set of words) of output. For simplification, this paper uses the following four notation rules:

Decoder: We employ a K-best beam-search decoder to find the (approximated) best outputˆYoutputˆ outputˆY given input X. shows atypical Kbest beam search algorithm used in the decoder of EncDec approach. We define the (minimal) required information h shown in for the jth decoding process is the following triplet, h = (
, where s j−1 is the cumulative log-likelihood from step 0 to j − 1,
is a (candidate of) output word sequence generated so far from step 0 to j − 1, that is, ˆ Y j−1 = (y 0 , . . . , y j−1 ) and H t j−1 is the all the hidden states for calculating the j-th decoding process. Then, the function calcLL in Line 8 can be written as follows:
where Softmax(·) is the softmax function fora given vector and Ω t (·) represents the overall process of a single decoding step.
where C is the number of complete sentences in Q c . The (m, k)-element of˜Oof˜ of˜O represents a likelihood of the m-th word, namelyõnamely˜namelyõ j, that is calculated using the k-th candidate in Q w at the (j − 1)-th step. In Line 12, the function makeTriplet constructs a set of triplets based on the information of index ( ˆ m, ˆ k). Then, in Line 13, the function selectTopK selects the top-K candidates from union of a set of generated triplets at current step {h z } K−C z=1 and a set of triplets of complete sentences in Q c . Finally, the function sepComp in Line 13 divides a set of triplets Q in two distinct sets whether they are complete sentences, Q c , or not, Q w . If the elements in Q are all complete sentences, namely, Q c = Q and Q w = ∅, then the algorithm stops according to the evaluation of Line 15.
section: Word Frequency Estimation
This section describes our proposed method, which roughly consists of two parts: (1) a submodel that estimates the upper-bound frequencies of the target vocabulary words in the output, and (2) architecture for controlling the output words in the decoder using estimations.
section: Definition
LetâLetˆLetâ denote a vector representation of the frequency estimation. denotes element-wise product. ˆ a is calculated by:
where Sigmoid(·) and ReLu(·) represent the element-wise sigmoid and ReLU), respectively. Thus,
We incorporate two separated components, ˆ r andˆgandˆ andˆg, to improve the frequency fitting. The purpose ofˆgofˆ ofˆg is to distinguish whether the target words occur or not, regardless of their frequency. Thus, ˆ g can be interpreted as agate function that resembles estimating the fertility in the coverage () and a switch probability in the copy mechanism. These ideas originated from such gated recurrent networks as LSTM) and GRU (). Then, ˆ r can much focus onto model frequency equal to or larger than 1. This separation can be expected sincê r[m] has no influence ifˆgifˆ ifˆg[m] = 0.
section: Effective usage
The technical challenge of our method is effectively leveraging WFEâWFEˆWFEâ. Among several possible choices, we selected to integrate it as prior knowledge in the decoder. To do so, we re-defineõdefine˜defineõ j in Eq. 2 as:
The difference is the additional term ofãof˜ofã j , which is an adjusted likelihood for the j-th step originally calculated fromâfromˆfromâ. We defineãdefine˜defineã j as:
ClipReLU 1 (·) is a function that receives a vector and performs an element-wise calculation:
) for all m if it receives x. We define the relation betweeñ r j in Eq. 4 andˆrandˆ andˆr in Eq. 3 as follows:
Eq. 5 is updated from˜rfrom˜ from˜r j−1 tõ r j with the estimated output of previous stepˆystepˆ stepˆy j−1 . Sincê y j ∈ {0, 1} M for all j, all of the elements iñ
. This means that the m-th word will never be selected anymore at step j ≤ j for all j. Thus, the interpretation of˜r of˜ of˜r j is that it directly manages the upper-bound frequency of each target word that can occur in the current and future decoding time steps. As a result, decoding with our method never generates words that exceed the estimationˆrestimationˆ estimationˆr, and thus we expect to reduce the redundant repeating generation.
Note here that our method never requires˜r requires˜ requires˜r j [m] ≤ 0 (or˜ror˜ or˜r j [m] = 0) for all mat the last decoding time step j, as is generally required in the occurrence estimation Output: (g, r)
Figure 2: Procedure for calculating the components of our WFE sub-model. coverage (. This is why we say upper-bound frequency estimation, not just (exact) frequency. shows the detailed procedure for calculating g and r in Eq. 3. For r, we sum up all of the features of the input given by the encoder (Line 2) and estimate the frequency. In contrast, for g, we expect Lines 5 and 6 to work as a kind of voting for both positive and negative directions since g needs just occurrence information, not frequency. For example, g may take large positive or negative values if a certain input word (feature) has a strong influence for occurring or not occurring specific target word(s) in the output. This idea is borrowed from the Max-pooling layer (Goodfellow et al., 2013).
section: Calculation
section: Parameter estimation (Training)
Given the training data, let a * ∈ PM be a vector representation of the true frequency of the target words given the input, where P = {0, 1, . . . , +∞}. Clearly a * can be obtained by counting the words in the corresponding output. We define loss function Ψ wfe for estimating our WFE sub-model as follows:
where W represents the overall parameters. The form of Ψ wfe (·) is closely related to that used in support vector regression (SVR) ( of a * are an integer. The remaining 0.25 for both the positive and negative sides denotes the margin between every integer. We select b = 2 to penalize larger for more distant error, and c 1 < c 2 , i.e., c 1 = 0.2, c 2 = 1, since we aim to obtain upper-bound estimation and to penalize the underestimation below the true frequency a * . Finally, we minimize Eq. 6 with a standard negative log-likelihood objective function to estimate the baseline EncDec model.
section: Experiments
We investigated the effectiveness of our method on ABS experiments, which were first performed by. The data consist of approximately 3.8 million training, 400,000 validation and 400,000 test data, respectively 2 . Generally, 1951 test data, randomly extracted from the test data section, are used for evaluation . Additionally, DUC-2004 evaluation data were also evaluated by the identical models trained on the above Gigaword data. We strictly followed the instructions of the evaluation setting used in previous studies fora fair comparison. Table 1 summarizes the model configuration and the parameter estimation setting in our experiments. shows the results of the baseline EncDec and our proposed EncDec+WFE.

For a validity confirmation of our EncDec baseline, we also performed OpenNMT tool 5 . The results on Gigaword data with B = 5 were, 33.65, 16.12, and 31.37 for ROUGE-1(F), ROUGE-2(F) and ROUGE-L(F), respectively, which were almost similar results (but slightly lower) with our implementation. This supports that our baseline worked well as a strong baseline. Clearly, EncDec+WFE significantly outperformed the strong EncDec baseline by a wide margin on the ROUGE scores. Thus, we conclude that the WFE sub-model has a positive impact to gain the ABS performance since performance gains were derived only by the effect of incorporating our WFE sub-model. lists the current top system results. Our method EncDec+WFE successfully achieved the current best scores on most evaluations. This result also supports the effectiveness of incorporating our WFE sub-model.

MRT essentially complements our method. We expect to further improve its performance by applying MRT for its training since recent progress of NMT has suggested leveraging a sequence-wise optimization technique for improving performance). We leave this as our future work. shows actual generation examples. Based on our motivation, we specifically selected the redundant repeating output that occurred in the baseline EncDec. It is clear that EncDec+WFE successfully reduced them. This observation offers further evidence of the effectiveness of our method in quality.

We quantizedâquantizedˆquantizedâ byâbyâ[m]+0.5 for all m, where 0.5 was derived from the margin in Ψ wfe . Unfortunately, the result looks not so well. There seems to exist an enough room to improve the estimation. However, we emphasize that it already has an enough power to improve the overall quality as shown in and. We can expect to further gain the overall performance by improving the performance of the WFE sub-model.
section: Conclusion
This paper discussed the behavior of redundant repeating generation often observed in neural EncDec approaches. We proposed a method for reducing such redundancy by incorporating a submodel that directly estimates and manages the frequency of each target vocabulary in the output. Experiments on ABS benchmark data showed the effectiveness of our method, EncDec+WFE, for both improving automatic evaluation performance and reducing the actual redundancy. Our method is suitable for lossy compression tasks such as image caption generation tasks.
